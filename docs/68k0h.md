# The 0h Command

The calculator can work with numbers written in three bases: decimal (the usual), binary, and hexadecimal. The 0h command indicates that a number is written in [hexadecimal](68k:glossary.html#hexadecimal):
```
:0h10
           16
:0h2F6
           758
```

When written in hexadecimal, numbers are expressed as signed 32-bit integers (32 bits correspond to 8 hexadecimal digits), which means that only the integers between -2<sup>31</sup> and 2<sup>31</sup>-1 can be expressed in hexadecimal. With other hexadecimal-related commands, numbers are simply truncated to fit in this range. Not so with 0h: if you enter more than 8 hexadecimal digits after the 0b, the result is a domain error.

Even if the calculator is in hexadecimal mode, you still have to write 0h for an integer to be interpreted as hexadecimal: the mode setting only affects output. If the calculator is in decimal mode, which is the default, you have to use [68k:▶Hex](68k:-hex.html) to get output in hexadecimal.
