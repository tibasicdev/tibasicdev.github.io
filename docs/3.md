# The ³ Command

The ³ command raises an input to the third power. It has exactly the same function as "^3", but is one byte smaller. If used on a list, it will return a list with all of the elements cubed. If used on a matrix, it will return the third matrix power of the input matrix.

```
2³
		8
{1,‾2,3}³
		{1 ‾8 27}
[[2,‾1][‾3,0]]³
		[[20  ‾7]
		 [‾21  6]]
```

## Advanced Uses

One trick with ³ is to use it to save space (at the cost of speed) when using hard-coded values.  For instance, use 5³ instead of 125 to save one byte.

## Optimization

Use this command instead of ^3 in all instances.

```
:X^3
can be
:X³
```
