# The % Command

The % symbol is an undocumented command on the TI-83 series calculators starting with OS version 1.15. It's useful as a shortcut for percents - it divides by 100, so it will convert numbers to percentages. For example, 50% will become 50/100 or 1/2, which is just what 50% should be.

Although this trick can save you a few bytes, it also makes your program incompatible with old OS versions — it's up to you to decide if the tradeoff is worth it.  

The % symbol is not quite equivalent to the value 0.01: typing in % by itself will give you a syntax error, as expected.

## Entering the % symbol

There are several assembly programs out there that can let you access the % symbol if you know what you're doing, but here is a short, self-contained way. First, create an assembly program by entering the following into the program editor:

```
:AsmPrgmEFF1423605C9
:BBDA
```

Then compile it: for example, if you entered the above into prgmX, and prgmY is free, then you can run

```
AsmComp(prgmX,prgmY
```

Then run the compiled assembly program:

```
Asm(prgmY
```

Now the compiled assembly program will become unlocked and contain the characters:

```
:??ˣ√B6BoxPlotsinh⁻¹(%
```

Most of this is garbage data and can be deleted, and the final character is the % character we wanted. (If you delete the other characters, then the % symbol can be accessed at any time by pressing [2nd][RCL] and choosing prgmY.)
