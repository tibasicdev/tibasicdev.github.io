# The P►Ry( Command

P►Ry( (polar to rectangular y-coordinate) calculates the y-coordinate of a polar point.  Polar coordinates are of the form (r,θ), where θ is the counterclockwise angle made with the positive x-axis, and r is the distance away from the origin (the point (0,0)).  The conversion identity y=r*sin(θ) is used to calculate P►Ry(.

The value returned depends on whether the calculator is in [radian](radian-mode.html) or [degree](degree-mode.html) mode. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion from radians to degrees is angle*180/π and from degrees to radians is angle*π/180.  The P►Ry( command also accepts a list of points.

```
P►Ry(5,π/4)
	3.535533906
5*sin(π/4)
	3.535533906
P►Ry({1,2},{π/4,π/3})
	{.7071067812 1.732050808}
```

## Advanced Uses

You can bypass the mode setting by using the [°](degree-symbol.html) (degree) and <sup>[r](radian-symbol.html)</sup> (radian) symbols.  This next command will return the same values no matter if your calculator is in degrees or radians:
```
P►Ry(1,{π/4^^r,60°})
	{.7071067812 .8660254038}
```

## Optimization

In most cases P►Ry(r,θ) can be replaced by r*sin(θ) to save a byte:

```
:P►Ry(5,π/12)
can be
:5sin(π/12)
```

Conversely, complicated expressions multiplied by a sine factor can be simplified by using P►Ry(r,θ) instead.

```
:(A+BX)sin(π/5)
can be
:P►Ry(A+BX,π/5)
```

## Error Conditions

- **[ERR:DIM MISMATCH](errors.html#dimmismatch)** is thrown if two list arguments have different dimensions.
- **[ERR:DATA TYPE](errors.html#datatype)** is thrown if you input a complex argument.
