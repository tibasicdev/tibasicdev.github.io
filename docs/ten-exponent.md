The `10^(` command raises 10 to a power. Since it's possible to just type out 1, 0, ^, and (, the reason for having a separate function isn't immediately obvious, but the command is occasionally useful.

`10^(` accepts numbers and lists as arguments. It also works for complex numbers.

```
10^(2)
     100
10^({-1,0,1})
     {0.1 1 10}
```

## Optimization

Don't type `10^(` out, use this command instead. It's three bytes smaller and usually faster as well. However, keep in mind that you might be able to use the [`E`](e-ten.html) command instead of `10^(`, for constant values.

## Command Timings

The command `10^(` is faster than typing out `10^(` in most cases, except for small integer arguments. Even faster is [`E`](e-ten.html), but that only works for raising 10 to a constant power.
