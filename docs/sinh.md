# The sinh( Command

Calculates the hyperbolic sine of a value. The hyperbolic trig functions sinh(, [cosh(](cosh.html), and [tanh(](tanh.html) are an analog of normal trig functions, but for a hyperbola, rather than a circle. They can be expressed in terms of real powers of [e](e-value.html), and don't depend on the [Degree](degree-mode.html) or [Radian](radian-mode.html) mode setting.

Like normal trig commands, sinh( works on lists as well, but not on complex numbers, even though the function is often extended to the complex numbers in mathematics.

## Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic sine is:
$$
\sinh{x}=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$$
