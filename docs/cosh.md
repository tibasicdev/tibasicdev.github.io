# The cosh( Command

Calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a value. The hyperbolic trig functions [`sinh(`](sinh.html), `cosh(`, and [`tanh(`](tanh.html) are an analog of normal trig functions, but for a hyperbola, rather than a circle. They can be expressed in terms of real powers of [`e`](e-value.html), and don't depend on the [Degree](degree-mode.html) or [Radian](radian-mode.html) mode setting.

Like normal trig commands, `cosh(` works on [lists](lists.html) as well, but not on complex numbers, even though the function is often extended to the complex numbers in mathematics.

## Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic cosine is:
$$
\cosh{x}=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$$
