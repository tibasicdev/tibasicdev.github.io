# Basic Graphing
### Setting up your Graph screen

Using the **window** button you can acces the *window* menu. In this menu you can read the following:

1. Xmin 
2. Xmax
3. Xscl
4. Ymin
5. Ymax
6. Yscl
7. Xres

### Xmin

------

This is the value on which the calculator **starts** the X-axis of the graph (the minimum value a X coordinate can have).  For instance, you need the **X-axis** to go from -2 till 10. In that case you would enter -2 here
note: You must use the (-) button instead of the - button, the (-) button declares a negative value whilst the - button declares to subtract value A from value B.

### Xmax

------

This is the value on which te calculator **Ends** the X-axis of the graph (the maximum value a X coordinate can have). For instance, you need the **X-axis** to go from -2 till 10. In that case you would enter 10 here.

### Xscl

------

This is the value on which te calculator **Draws a point** along the X-axis of the graph. For instance, you need a point after each 5 *values* in that case you would enter 5 here

### Ymin

------

This is the value on which the calculator **starts** the Y-axis of the graph (the minimum value a Y coordinate can have).  For instance, you need the **Y-axis** to go from -2 till 10. In that case you would enter -2 here
note: You must use the (-) button instead of the - button, the (-) button declares a negative value whilst the - button declares to subtract value A from value B.

### Ymax

------

This is the value on which te calculator **Ends** the Y-axis of the graph (the maximum value a Y coordinate can have). For instance, you need the **Y-axis** to go from -2 till 10. In that case you would enter 10 here

### Yscl

------

This is the value on which te calculator **Draws a point** along the Y-axis of the graph. For instance, you need a point after each 5 *values* in that case you would enter 5 here

### Xres

------
