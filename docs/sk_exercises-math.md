# Math Review Exercises
Let's review the commands you have learned concerning mathematical operations. Highlight the area next to the word **Answer** to reveal the answer. If there are certain topics you don't feel confident in yet, don't worry. Just go back to the appropriate page and review.

 **1**. *True* or *False*: Subtraction is the same as adding a negative number.

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|True. 5 - 2 = 5 + -2##

**2**. Which of the following expressions are equivalent?

1. abs(-5)
2. -30 / 6
3. int(-5.5)
4. 5<sup>1</sup>
5. 30 / 5

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|Choices 1 and 4, which both equal 5.##

**3**. *True* or *False*: The complex number *i* squared is equal to one.

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|False. *i*<sup>2</sup> = -1##

**4**. Evaluate the following expression. Remember the Order of Operations.

$$24 / 4 + 2 * (9 - √9) / 3$$

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|The answer is 10. Remember PEMDAS##

**5**. Which of the following commands will calculate the number of possible 3-digit number lock codes? The code can use the numbers 0 - 30 and order *does* matter.

1. 3 nPr 30
2. 30 nCr 3
3. 3 nCr 31
4. 31 nPr 3

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|Choice 4. Order matters, making the code a *permutation*. The length of the code, or *r*, is 3 digits, and the number of possible digits. or *n*, is 31, because we can use all numbers from 1 to 30 as well as 0.##

**6**. *True* or *False*: The default base of log(n) is 10.

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|True. To get a different base, use the logBASE function or the formula: log(x)/log(b) = log<sub>b</sub>(x)##

**7**. Which of the following trigonometric identities is correct?

1. cos(x) - sin(x) = tan(x)
2. tan(x) + cos(x) = sin(x)
3. sin(x) / cos(x) = tan(x)
4. sin(x) * tan(x) = cos(x)

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|Choice 3.##

**8**. The max() command can be used as a space-saving substitute for which kind of logical operator?

**Answer**: ##e7e9dc|The operator OR. The min() command can be used as a substitute for AND statements.##
