# The χ²cdf( Command

`χ²cdf(` is the χ² cumulative density function. If some random variable follows a χ² distribution, you can use this command to find the probability that this variable will fall in the interval you supply.

The command takes three arguments. *lower* and *upper* define the interval in which you're interested. *df* specifies the degrees of freedom (choosing one of a family of χ² distributions).

## Advanced Uses

Often, you want to find a "tail probability" - a special case for which the interval has no lower or no upper bound. For example, "what is the probability x is greater than 2?". The TI-83+ has no special symbol for infinity, but you can use `E99` to get a very large number that will work equally well in this case (`E` is the decimal exponent obtained by pressing [2nd] [EE]). Use `E99` for positive infinity, and `-E99` for negative infinity.

The `χ²cdf(` command is crucial to performing a χ² goodness of fit test, which the early TI-83 series calculators do not have a command for (the [`χ²-Test(`](chisquare-test.html) command performs the χ² test of independence, which is not the same thing, although the manual always just refers to it as the "χ² Test"). This test is used to test if an observed frequency distribution differs from the expected, and can be used, for example, to tell if a coin or die is fair.

The [Goodness-of-Fit Test](goodness-of-fit.html) routine on the [routines](routines.html) page will perform a χ² goodness of fit test for you. Or, if you have a TI-84+/SE with OS version 2.30 or higher, you can use the [`χ²GOF-Test(`](chisquaregof-test.html) command.

## Formulas

As with other continuous distributions, we can define `χ²cdf(` in forms of the probability density function:

$$\operatorname{\chi^2cdf}(a,b,k) = \int_a^b \operatorname{\chi^2pdf}(x,k)\,dx$$
