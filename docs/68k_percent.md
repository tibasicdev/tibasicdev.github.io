# The % Command

The % operator is a cheap shortcut for dividing a number by 100: for instance, 25% = 25/100 = 1/4. When used on a list or matrix, it divides every element by 100.

It's somewhat higher in priority than regular division, so you don't need parentheses as often with it: for instance, 4^50% is equal to 4^(1/2)=2, not to (4^50)%.
