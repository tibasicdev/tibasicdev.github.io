# The Clear Entries Command

Normally, by pressing 2nd ENTER repeatedly, you can cycle through some of the recent entries on the home screen. With the `Clear Entries` command, this history is cleared (only `Clear Entries` remains in the history). 

This can be used to free some memory, although it's recommended not to do this in a program (because clearing things without asking first isn't nice). Aside from that, maybe the only reason to use `Clear Entries` is to protect your privacy — although someone looking at your entries will know you cleared something, so it's not that effective.
