# The ∑() Command

∑() is used to add a sequence of numbers. ∑(*expression*, *variable*, *start*, *end*) will evaluate *expression* for *variable*=*start*, then for *variable*=*start*+1, all the way through *variable*=*end*, and add up the results:

```
:∑(f(x),x,1,5)
           f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)
:∑(x^2,x,1,5)
           55
```

In this way, ∑() is no different from taking [68k:sum()](68k:sum().html) of a sequence generated by [68k:seq()](68k:seq().html). However, ∑() can be used for more abstract calculations — for instance, when *start* or *end* is an undefined variable, it will try to find the sum in terms of that variable. ∑() can also be used to sum an infinite series (just make the value of *end* infinity — ∞). 

```
:∑(x^2,x,1,n)
           n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6           
:∑(2^-x,x,1,∞)
           1
```

## Optimization

It's a good idea to replace sum(seq( by ∑( whenever it occurs. The only difficulty arises if seq() uses its *step* argument, since ∑() doesn't have one. There are three options:
- Forget about using ∑() and just go with the sum(seq( alternative.
- Use a [68k:when()](68k:when().html) expression (probably with [68k:mod()](68k:mod().html)) to select the entries you care about.
- Use a linear equation to transform values from 1 to N into the correct values with the step.

Here is an example of these approaches: 
```
:sum(seq(x^2,x,1,9,2))
```
This calculates 1<sup>2</sup>+3<sup>2</sup>+5<sup>2</sup>+7<sup>2</sup>+9<sup>2</sup>.

```
:∑(when(mod(x,2)=1,x^2,0),x,1,9)
```
The when() command selects only the odd numbers — those with mod(x,2)=1 — from 1 to 9.

```
:∑((2x-1)^2,x,1,5)
```
The equation 2*x-1 transforms the numbers 1..5 into the odd numbers 1..9.
