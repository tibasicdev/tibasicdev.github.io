# The identity( Command

The `identity(` command generates an identity matrix: that is, a matrix [B] such that for any other matrix [A], [A]*[B]=[A] (if [A] is the right size to make the multiplication valid). 

The identity matrix is square (that is, the row dimension equals the column dimension); all of its elements are 0 except for the elements along the main diagonal (the diagonal going from top left to bottom right).

The command itself takes one argument: the size of the matrix, used for both row and column size, that is, `identity(n)` creates an *n* by *n* matrix.

```
:dim([A]
:identity(Ans(2→[B]
:[A][B]=[A]  // should always return 1, meaning 'true'
```

## Optimization

The `identity(` command can be used as a quick way to create an empty square matrix: `0identity(n)` will create an *n* by *n* matrix containing only 0 as an element. This is faster and smaller than the [`dim(`](dim.html) and [`Fill(`](fill.html) commands used for the same purpose:

```
:{5,5→dim([A]
:Fill(0,[A]
can be
:0identity(5→[A]
```

## Error Conditions

- **[ERR:INVALID DIM](errors.html#invaliddim)** occurs if the size is not an integer 1-99. In practice, however, `identity(21)` is already too large for the calculator to generate.
- **[ERR:MEMORY](errors.html#memory)** occurs if the size of the created matrix exceeds memory limits. This limit is hard-fixed to 3611 bytes (the size of a 20x20 matrix), regardless of having sufficient RAM to hold a larger matrix.
