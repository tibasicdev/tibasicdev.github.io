# xLIB
[xLIB](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/359/35907.html) is a TI-83+/84+/SE assembly application created by [Patrick Prendergast (tr1p1ea)](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/82/8279.html), and it adds additional functionality to TI-Basic programs. It works by installing a parser hook which will intercept any [real(](real-func.html) command requests.

Some of its features include:

- Fast sprites/tilemapping
- Faster key routines
- Scrolling the screen
- Executing archived programs

## Documentation

Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of documentation that has been created for xLIB. The three main pieces of documentation that have been created so far include the [readme](xlib-readme.html) file itself, a [tutorial](xlib-tutorial.html) heavily based on the readme, and a [masked sprites](xlib:masked-sprites.html) tutorial explaining how to use xLIB to create masked sprites. We can hopefully create more documentation at some point in the future.
