# Resources
At the time of this revision, there is very little known documentation on how to program Nspire calculators. Below is a list of resources that contain information on Nspire Basic.

- [This article details how to make a program on Nspire family calculators.](https://epsstore.ti.com/oa_html/csksxvm.jsp?nsetid-93482)

- [TI Codes by Texas Instruments contains some basic information on how to program an Nspire.](https://education.ti.com/en/activities/ti-codes/nspire)

- [Former teacher John Hanna has made some very impressive Nspire programs (though most appear to be in Lua, not TI-Basic), so check these out if you're looking for example Nspire programs and games.](http://www.johnhanna.us/ti-nspire.htm)

- [This PDF shows some basics of making Nspire programs, then demonstrates how to make complex math programs.](https://www.tinspireapps.com/resources/how_to_program_the_ti-nspire.pdf)

- [This YouTube playlist has several videos showing how to do algebraic things on Nspire calculators.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list-plymatwdt44uggiqczo1s018wkb9au0zwr)
