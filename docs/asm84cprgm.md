# The Asm84CPrgm Command
Please see the [`AsmPrgm`](asmprgm.html) page. The functionality and use is the same between both commands. However, the `Asm84CPrgm` is only available on the TI-84+CSE calculator. Keep in mind that hexadecimal for the monochrome calculators may not work on color calculators.
