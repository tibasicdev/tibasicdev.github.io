# Sample Programs
The programs linked from this page are complete (if simple) programs, presented with source code and an explanation. They are meant as a way of putting everything that is on this guide together into an example of what TI-Basic programmers like you can do. For readers who learn better by example than by explanation, these games are also a great way to learn the techniques explained in this guide.

These programs have been fully [optimized](68k:optimization.html), except where this would interfere with readability. For example, the names of variables could easily be converted to single characters — this was deliberately left undone. The individual pages explain what would be done to finish the job of optimization.
