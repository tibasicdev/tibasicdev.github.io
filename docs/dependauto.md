# The DependAuto Command

When the `DependAuto` setting (opposed to the [`DependAsk`](dependask.html) setting) is turned on, values in the table are automatically calculated. With [`IndpntAuto`](indpntauto.html), that means the table is automatically filled out completely; with [`IndpntAsk`](indpntask.html), that means that as soon as you enter a value for the independent variable, all the values of the dependent variables are calculated. This is usually the setting you want to use.
