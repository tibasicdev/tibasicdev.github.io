# The ΣPrn( Command

The `ΣPrn(` command calculates, for an [amortization schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amortization_schedule), the principal amount over a range of payments: the portion of those payments that went toward paying off the principal. Its two required arguments are *payment1* and *payment2*, which define the range of payments we're interested in. However, it also uses the values of the finance variables PV, PMT, and I% in its calculations.

The optional argument, *roundvalue*, is the number of digits to which the calculator will round all internal calculations. Since this rounding affects further steps, this isn't the same as using [`round(`](round.html) to round the result of `ΣPrn(` to the same number of digits.

Usually, you will know the values of `**N**`, `PV`, and `I%`, but not `PMT`. This means you'll have to use the finance solver to solve for `PMT` before calculating `ΣPrn(`; virtually always, `FV` will equal 0.

## Sample Problem

*Imagine that you have taken out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The loan amount is $100000, and the annual interest rate (APR) is 8%. Payments will be made monthly. How much of the principal amount was paid in the first five years?*

We know the values of `**N**`, `I%`, and `PV`, though we still need to convert them to monthly values (since payments are made monthly). `**N**` is 30*12, and `I%` is 8/12. `PV` is just 100000.

Now, we use the finance solver to solve for `PMT`. Since you intend to pay out the entire loan, `FV` is 0. Using either the interactive TVM solver, or the [`tvm_Pmt`](tvm.html) command, we get a value of about -$733.76 for `PMT`.

We are ready to use `ΣPrn(`. We are interested in the payments made during the first five years; that is, between the 1<sup>st</sup> payment and the 5*12=60<sup>th</sup> payment. `ΣPrn(1,60)` gives us the answer: -$4930.14 (the negative sign simply indicates the direction of cash flow)

## Formulas

The formula that the calculator uses for `ΣPrn(` is in terms of [`bal(`](bal.html):

$$
\operatorname{\Sigma Prn}(n_1,n_2)=\operatorname{bal}(n_2)-\operatorname{bal}(n_1)$$

When the *roundvalue* argument isn't given, we can substitute the explicit formula for `bal(` and simplify to get the following formula:

$$
\operatorname{\Sigma Prn}(n_1,n_2)=\left(\operatorname{PV}-\frac{\operatorname{PMT}}{I\%/100}\right)\left[\left(1-\frac{I\%}{100}\right)^{n_1}-\left(1-\frac{I\%}{100}\right)^{n_2}\right]$$

## Error Conditions

- **[ERR:DOMAIN](errors.html#domain)** is thrown if either payment number is negative or a decimal.
