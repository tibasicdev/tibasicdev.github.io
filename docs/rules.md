# Rules and Code of Conduct
## Forum Rules
------

- Always be respectful of other posters, including their opinions, values, point-of-view, etc.

- Always try to work with other posters instead of against them; this is a community and we are all here to help.

- Don't post or request anything illegal or illicit, including ROMs, music, movies, porn, etc.

- No cursing, spamming, or flaming.

- Don't advertise your programs or websites, unless they are relevant and have some unique value to them.

- Don't reply to old threads (last post is more than three months old); start a new thread instead.

- Place threads in the appropriate category; Additionally, if a thread starts to go off-topic please start a new one.

- Don't try to pass off someone else's work as your own — give credit to the author whenever possible.

- If you have been banned, do not use an alternate account to bypass your ban. We only ban users who have broken these rules, and all of your alternate accounts will be banned if we find there is reasonable proof to believe that it is the same person behind the two accounts.
