**RPG's** (Role-Playing-Games) are games in which the user pretends to be a different character, and makes decisions affecting their world. There are many types of RPGs that can be made on a graphing calculator. 

- **[Text Adventure](text-adventure.html)s** — Text adventures can use the [Menu(](menu.html) command or a custom menu to create text-based selections to advance gameplay. Pretty easy to program.
- **[Fighting RPG](fighting-rpg.html)s** — Such as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, or Pokémon, these games incorporate fighting into the progression of the storyline.
