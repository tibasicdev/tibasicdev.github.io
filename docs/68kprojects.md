# Project Ideas
Now that you have learned the commands, design theory and game techniques, it's time to put that information to use. These project ideas are for programs that you should try to make to the given specifications, using whatever commands you need. Of course, the specifications aren't set in stone, so you don't have to include something if you don't want to.

In addition to following the specifications, try to make the programs as optimized as possible, and use good design when structuring them (i.e., don't use [68k:Goto](68k:goto.html) when a [68k:loop](68k:loop.html) is really what you should be using). If you can successfully make all of these programs, and have done a good job writing them, you can consider yourself a good programmer.

If you are having trouble making any of the programs, or you just want some input from other people, you can post in the [forum](forum:home.html). Before you do that, though, we encourage you to really try to create the programs and put some thought into them.

- Randomly display a piece of food on the screen for the snake to "eat".
- Use collision detection to check if the food was eaten or the snake went off the screen.

- The guessing player gets ten chances to guess the word before they lose.
- The guessing player selects a letter that they think is in the word. If the letter is there, then that letter is revealed and the player doesn't lose a chance.
