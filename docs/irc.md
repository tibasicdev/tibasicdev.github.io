# Guide to IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
## What is IRC?
IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, and is a tool that allows users to communicate with each other quickly and efficiently. An IRC comes in the form of a client, which means you would have to download it to be able to use it. There are many networks in IRC (common ones such as freenode, EFnet, IRCNet) and within those networks, you can find channels (where the "actual" communication takes place). The TIBD has its own channel named *#tibasicdev*, which is really useful for those who have questions regarding calculators or programming. Here is a tutorial that will give you step by step instructions on how to connect to our IRC channel.

## Step 1: Obtaining an IRC
The first step to connecting to IRC is actually getting an IRC client. There are many IRC's out there, but I will mention a few across  the most common platforms. Here are my suggestions.

- **Linux**
 - [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html)
 - [Irssi](https://irssi.org/download/)
 - [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/downloads)
- **Windows**
 - [KVIrc](http://www.kvirc.net/?id-download-lang-en)
 - [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/get.html)
 - [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/downloads)
 - [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html)
- **Mac OS X** 
 - [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/)
 - [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/downloads.html)
 - [Textual 6](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)
- **iOS**
 - [Mutter](https://www.mutterirc.com/)
 - [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/)
- **Android**
 - [HoloIRC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id-com.fusionx.lightirc-hl-en) 
 - [Rice IRC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id-it.mneri.android.rice-hl-en)
 
## Step 2: Connecting to a network
For this tutorial, I will be using [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/downloads) since it is easy to configure. Most other IRC's should setup similarly, so if you are using another IRC, the process should fairly be the same. Once you have an IRC client, open it up. A setup window should pop up. Click "Next" and you should see a "General" tab and "Away" tab.

In the "General" tab, you can add nicknames that will show up as you in IRC, and you can also add your real name if you like. In the "Away" tab, you can add an away message, which is displayed when you leave the IRC.

Once you have configured those tabs, click "Next". You will then see a space asking for a Network. By default it will be on Freenode, but don't worry about this yet. Click "Save & Connect". From there, you will need to go to File>Networks>Configure Networks. You should see this screen.

Click on the "Add" button and another window should open. By default, you will be on the option of a preset network. Select "EFnet from the drop down list and press OK in the current window and Network window. You should be at the home page now (Make sure the network EFnet is highlighted before continuing).
## Step 3:Connect to a Channel
Now look near the top of the screen, and you should see four buttons (Connect to IRC Disconnect from IRC, Join Channel, Leave Currently selected channel). Click on "Connect to IRC" to connect to the EFnet network. You will know you are connected when the text "EFnet" is black (Gray text means there is no connection). Now click on "Join Channel" and you should see a window. Type "#tibasicdev" in the channel space, then click OK.

Congratulations, you are now at the TIBD channel! If you have any problems connecting you can discuss them [here](http://tibasicdev.github.io/forum/t-2162236/irc).
