# Writing Conventions
This page is to reduce confusion when reading code here on the forums. The conventions found on this page are the ones which are the accepted standard on this and many other coding sites. Many of these characters can be found in the character box at the top right of your page, where you can copy and paste them. However, if you find this difficult, you can use the conventions as they are below.
