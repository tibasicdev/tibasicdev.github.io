# The setTime( Command

The setTime( command sets the time of the clock on the TI-84+/SE calculators. It takes three arguments: the hour, the minute, and the second. The hour must be in 24 hour format — where 13 is equal to 1 P.M. — and the minute and second need to be a valid number within the appropriate range (1-60). For example, this would set the time to 12:30:30:

```
:setTime(12,30,30
```

Once you have set the time, you can display it in two different formats on the [mode screen](settings.html) using the [setTmFmt(](settmfmt.html) command: 12 (12 hour) or 24 (24 hour). Of course, the time will only show up if the clock is on; if you need to turn the clock on, use the [ClockOn](clockon.html) command, or scroll down to the 'TURN CLOCK ON' message that is displayed in place of the clock on the mode screen and press ENTER twice.
