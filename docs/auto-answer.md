# The AUTO Answer Command

The `AUTO Answer` command is a mode command that changes the Answers mode to AUTO.  The AUTO mode is in essence the same mode that lower OS models use.  The calculator will evaluate a numerical expression and return a decimal or number in scientific notation, unless [`►Frac`](-frac.html) is used.

In the Mathprint mode, no noticeable difference is seen unless the answer is converted to a fraction.
