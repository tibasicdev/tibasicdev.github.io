# The AxesOn Command

The `AxesOn` command enables the X and Y axes on the graph screen, so that they are drawn. They can be disabled with the [`AxesOff`](axesoff.html) command.

(the y=x line that is drawn when both [`Seq`](seq-mode.html) and [`Web`](web.html) modes are enabled is also controlled by this command)
