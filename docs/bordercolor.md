# The BorderColor Command

There are only 4 borders to choose from, so using the default colors will not work. Instead, you may only use a value between 1-4.

For example, to change the border color to light blue, do:
```
BorderColor 3
```

Here are the color values:

| Color | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Light Gray | 1 |
| Snowy Mint / Light Madang | 2 |
| Light Blue | 3 |
| White | 4 |

The colors of borders 2 and 3 are not usable or accessible in any way except as a border color. The use of border colors 1 or 4 along with the appropriate background can create the illusion of a larger graph screen. However, nothing can be draw outside the standard window.
