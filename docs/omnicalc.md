# Omnicalc
[Omnicalc](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/226/22626.html) is a TI-83+/84+/SE assembly application created by [Michael Vincent](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/26/2675.html) of Detached Solutions, and it modifies your calculator to provide additional TI-Basic functions. It works by installing a parser hook which will intercept any [real(](real-func.html) command requests (although originally it actually had its own set of custom commands that it created and used). This is the same thing that [xLIB](xlib.html) does, which means that the applications could conflict when both are installed.

Some of Omnicalc's TI-Basic features include:

- Base conversion for a variety of number bases
- Built-in support for several common math constants
- Factoring a number into its prime parts
- Improved linking support sending/receiving bytes
- Sprites using parts of the picture variables

Besides the TI-Basic related features, Omnicalc also includes several other valuable features: a custom menu for placing common commands and functions, parentheses assistant for help entering in math expressions, protection for preventing people from messing with your calculator's memory, a thousands separators that inserts commas after every 3 digits of a number (for example, 1000000 would appear as 1,000,000), and a virtual calculator that allows you to switch back and forth between two calculators.

## Documentation

Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of documentation that has been created for Omnicalc. The main piece of documentation thas has been created so far is the [TI-Basic Greyscale](http://tibasicdev.github.io/local--files/downloads/basicgreyscale.zip) tutorial by Kevin Ouellet (DJ Omnimaga). This tutorial explains how to use Omnicalc together with [xLIB](xlib.html) to create greyscale sprites for use in games, although the version of xLIB that is referenced in the tutorial was just a regular assembly program. We hopefully can create some more documentation at some point in the future.
