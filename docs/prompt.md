# The Prompt Command

The `Prompt` command is the simplest way of getting [user input](userinput.html) on the [home screen](homescreen.html) (getting user input on the [graph screen](graphscreen.html) is only possible with the [`getKey`](getkey.html) command). Prompt displays [variables](variables.html) one per line, with an equal sign and question mark (=?) displayed to the right of each variable. After the user enters a value or expression for the variables and presses ENTER, the values will be stored to the variables and program execution will resume.

`Prompt` can be used with every variable, but some of the variables have to be entered in a certain way. If the variable is a string or equation, the user must put quotes ("") around the value; the user must also put curly braces ({}) around lists and square brackets ([]) around matrices. Of course, ending quotes, braces, and brackets can be left off as usual.

When you use `Prompt` to input a named list, the `∟` in front of the name is dropped (so `Prompt ∟NAME` will display NAME=?). This can be confusing with single-letter names: `Prompt ∟X` and `Prompt X` both display X=?. Further enhancing the confusion, if the user enters a list for `Prompt X`, the list will be stored to ∟X instead.

During the Prompt, the user can press [2nd][MODE] to quit the program immediately.

## Advanced Uses

Because simply displaying what variable the value will be stored to does not really tell the user what the variable will be used for, you can put a [`Disp`](disp.html) command before `Prompt` to give the user some more insight into what an appropriate value for the variable would be. The `Prompt` command will be displayed one line lower, though, because the `Disp` command automatically creates a new line after itself. (Of course, you could also just use the [`Input`](input.html) command.)

```
:Disp "Enter the Score
:Prompt A
```

## Optimizations

When you have a list of `Prompt` commands (and each one has its own variable), you can just use the first `Prompt` command and combine the rest of the other `Prompt` commands with it. You remove the `Prompt` commands and combine the arguments, separating each argument with a comma. The arguments can be composed of whatever combination of variables is desired.

The advantages of combining `Prompt` commands are that it makes scrolling through code faster, and it is more compact (i.e. smaller) and easier to write than using the individual `Prompt` commands. The primary disadvantage is that it is easier to accidentally erase a `Prompt` command with multiple arguments.

```
:Prompt A
:Prompt Str1
Combine the Prompts
:Prompt A,Str1
```
