# 68k Counting
Let's make a program that could define the variable B, as (10^10). Let's start! 
```
Count()
:Prgm
:  Local a,b
:  10^10→b
:  For a,1,b
:    Disp a
:  EndFor
:EndPrgm
```


Let's break this code down piece by piece starting from the beginning. 
```
counting()
:Prgm
```
The first code is the title of the project called "Count()" but you could make it whatever you want. While the second code is ": Prgm", which let's the calculator understand that it is a "program".
```
:  Local a,b
:  10^10→b
:  For a,1,b
:    Disp a
```
In this code, a "For loop" is established, which will store each successive number from 1 through B (10^10) in variable A.The program then outputs the data currently stored in Variable A, to character space 1,1 in the screen
```
:  EndFor
:EndPrgm
```

For this segment, "EndFor" ends the for loop after the code is executed. While "EndPrgm" ends the code.
