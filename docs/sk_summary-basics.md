# Basics Summary
1. TI-Basic is the built-in programming language on all of TI's graphing calculators.
2. When making programs, there is a general order that you follow: you create the program, then you edit the program, and finally you execute the program.
3. A variable is a place where a data can be stored globally. Each of the letters A through Z (as well as the θ symbol, which is Greek and pronounced "theta") is a variable that can hold a number.
4. Input happens when a program lets the person running it press a key or type something in, so that it can do something with that. Output happens when a program displays results on the screen.
5. Control structures are instructions that explain which steps the calculator should follow, and in which order.
6. The Goto command tells the calculator to jump to another point (more specifically, a corresponding Lbl) in the program, and continue running it from there.
7. Loops are a type of control structure used to repeat a block of code several times. There are two kinds of loops: a loop that repeats until a condition is satisfied and a loop that repeats a fixed number of times.
