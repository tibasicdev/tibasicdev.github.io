## How Ti Basic Programs Are Executed
Ti Basic Programs are executed by calling built-in functions already written for you on the calculator. Ti Basic Programs are really not executed, they are interpreted by the calculator's operating system. That means that the calculator 'reads' the programs, and then executes the appropriate function. For each command that is read in the calculator, several [native commands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/native_applications) may be executed. This means that the calculator's Central Processing Unit will have to do more processing to execute the program. This is usually not a problem for small, simple programs; but if you are considering making a game, or other complex application, it is probably a good idea to use Assembly as your programing language.

## How Assembly Programs are Executed
Assembly programs are executed natively. That means that the Central Processing Unit is able to directly interpret your code, instead of having to rely on commands from the operating system. This also gives you more control over the calculator.

### Too much control?
Before sending ANY assembly program to your calculator, make sure it is from a verified source. This is because when you execute an Assembly Program, you give the program complete control of the calculator. An assembly program can directly edit both RAM, and ROM, enabling it to erase the Operating System, install a virus, log your keystrokes. This is an Assembly Program is a [Native Application](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machine_code), meaning it is directly executed by the Central Processing Unit.

## Should I use Assembly?
If you are creating a rather simple program, or function , then you should probably stick with Ti-Basic. But, if you are creating a more complex program, like a game, then you might want to consider Assembly. Because Assembly runs faster, your game will have better performance.

## Where can I start?
The two main types of assembly programs are either written directly in Assembly, or in a Compiled language, like C. A compiled language is translated into Assembly, making it easier to learn. However, programming directly in assembly gives you more control.

### I am a beginner at assembly
If you are a complete beginner, and have never written in C, or C++, then you should start out with C. C is easier to write, and runs just about as fast.

### I have Programmed in C, or C++ before
I am completely familiar with the concepts of programming, and have had experience in a least one medium-low level language. This does NOT include C#, VB.NET, or JAVA, as these are considered high level languages.
