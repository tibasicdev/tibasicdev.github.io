# Powers and Exponentials
Another important class of math functions deals with powers, logarithms, and exponents.


## [^](power.html) operator

This operator, found on the keyboard, is the exponent operator. It will raise a number to a power.

## <sup>[-1](inverse.html)</sup>, <sup>[2](2.html)</sup>, <sup>[3](3.html)</sup>

These are shortcuts for the reciprocal, square, and cube of a number, respectively. <sup>-1</sup> and <sup>2</sup> can be found on the keyboard, while <sup>3</sup> can be pasted by pressing MATH, 3.

## Logarithms: [log(](log.html), [ln(](ln.html)

The [log(](log.html) and [ln(](ln.html) functions, both available from the keyboard, will calculate the logarithms to base 10 and base e, respectively.
To get logarithms to other bases, use the following formula:

```
:log(x)/log(b)
```
where *b* is the desired base.

A useful use of log( is to determine how many digits an integer has. An integer *n* will have
```
:int(log(abs(n)))+1
```
digits in base 10.

## [10^(](ten-exponent.html), [e^(](e-exponent.html), [E](e-ten.html)
These functions can be found on the keyboard, by pressing 2nd plus the respective logarithm key. Of course you could always type these out one character at a time, but using shortcuts takes less bytes. The [E](e-ten.html) (EE on the keypad) denotes and integer power of 10, and is commonly used for scientific notation. E cannot be used with variables or fractional exponents, but it is about twice as fast as 10^(.

## Roots: [√(](square-root.html), [³√(](cube-root.html), [ˣ√(](xroot.html)

These functions take the square root, cube root, and nth root of a number, respectively.

```
:5ˣ√(2)
```
will give the same result as
```
:2^(1/5)
```
namely, the 5th root of 2.
