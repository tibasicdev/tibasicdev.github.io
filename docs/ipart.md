# The iPart( Command

`iPart(*value*)` returns the integer part of *value*, and extends to complex numbers, lists, and matrices.
```
iPart(5.32)
               5
iPart(4/5)
               0
iPart(‾5.32)
               ‾5
iPart(‾4/5)
               0
```

`iPart` is sometimes used with it's corresponding partner [`fPart`](fpart.html). While `iPart` trims off the part *before* the decimal point, `fPart` trims off the part *after* it.

The difference between `iPart(` and [`int(`](int.html) is subtle; while `iPart(` always truncates its parameters, simply removing the integer part, `int(` always rounds down. This means that they return the same answers for positive numbers, but `int(` will return an answer 1 less than `iPart(` for (non-integer) negative numbers. For example, `iPart(-5.32)` is -5, while `int(-5.32)` is -6.

In this case of positive values, though, the decision to use `iPart(` or `int(` is mostly a matter of preference - some people only use `int(` because it is shorter, some people use `iPart(` when there is a corresponding [`fPart(`](fpart.html) taken. However, see the Command Timings section.

## Watch Out For Precision Issues

```
1/3*3→X   // X is expected to be 1
X         // Displays 1, but is actually 0.99999999999999 in memory
iPart(X)  // Displays 0
fPart(X)  // Displays 1, but is actually 0.99999999999999 in memory
```

Somewhat unintuitively, the code above displays the results 1, 0 and 1. This is due to the calculator storing values to 14 digits of precision, but rounding the value to 10 digits to fit on the home screen.

*Tip:* If you enter a value in the list editor screen, you will be able to see all 14 digits of precision. This can help you troubleshoot issues like these.

One workaround is to [round](round.html) the numbers prior to calling `iPart()` or `fPart()`, if you don't mind the slight loss in precision from 14 significant digits to 9 decimal places:

```
1/3*3→X
iPart(round(X,9))   // Displays the expected result 1
fPart(round(X,9))   // Displays the expected result 0
```

(The parameter 9 is not technically required here since 9 is the default, but is shown for clarity and in case you want to customize the level of precision.)


## Advanced Uses

`iPart(`, along with `fPart(` and `int(`, can be used for integer [compression](compression.html).

## Command Timings

The following table compares the speeds of `int(` and `iPart(`. Each command was timed over 2000 iterations to find a noticeable difference.

| Format | Bars | Pixels | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iPart(1 | 10 | 1 | 81 |
| iPart(1.643759 | 10 | 1 | 81 |
| int(1 | 8 | 7 | 71 |
| int(1.643759 | 10 | 2 | 82 |

Conclusion: With 5 or fewer decimal places, you should consider using `int(` because of its speed, but with more decimals, `iPart(` remains constant to eventually beat out its counterpart.
