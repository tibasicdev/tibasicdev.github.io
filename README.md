# TI-Basic Developer

As of August 2025, TI-Basic Developer is officially closed. Community engagement on the site has waned, larger interest in TI-Basic as a language is lower than ever, and Wikidot itself has proven to have precarious stability. Despite this sorry state of affairs, the content of TI-Basic Developer is of great importance to the history of calculator programming and small cohorts of programmers who yet remains.

A backup of all content pages was (finally) extracted in August 2025; this backup was converted from Wikidot's internal format to Markdown, which has then been used to produce this site. This conversion is, naturally, not able to capture all forms of formatting, but a plaintext format like Markdown ensures the site remains relatively navigable even offline.

If you encounter a page which is still unacceptably rendered, or entirely missing, please open an issue or PR.
