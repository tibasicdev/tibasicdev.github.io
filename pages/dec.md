# The ►Dec Command

This command is generally useless.  Its supposed use is to convert numbers into decimal form, but any typed fractions are displayed as decimals anyway.
```1/3
     .3333333333
1/3►Dec
     .3333333333
```

In 2.53 MP or higher, typed fractions are displayed in fraction form. Therefore, the `►Dec` command is useful in this case.
