# The ClrList Command

`ClrList` sets the length of a list (or several lists) to 0. This is virtually equivalent to deleting the list, except for several differences:

- The list still exists — it will be shown in the memory management menu and the list menu
- Calling the [`dim(`](dim.html) command on it will return 0, rather than an error.
- `ClrList` can clear multiple lists at the same time

## Advanced Uses

You might use `ClrList` when building up a list element by element and using `dim(` in the process:

```
:ClrList L1
:While 10>dim(L1
:Input X
:X→L1(1+dim(L1
:End
```


## Optimization

Using [`DelVar`](delvar.html) instead of `ClrList` allows you to save a tiny bit of memory (between 12 and 16 bytes) that `ClrList` doesn't delete, while keeping almost every aspect of the list clearing the same. If you are clearing several lists, you can separate them with commas as the arguments to `ClrList`, which can save space. Using `ClrList` is also substantially faster than `DelVar` if the list is going to be cleared many times.

## Error Conditions

- **[ERR:SYNTAX](errors.html#syntax)** is thrown if you leave off the [∟](l.html) symbol when referring to a custom list (i.e., `ClrList` B will not work; you have to use `ClrList` ∟B).
