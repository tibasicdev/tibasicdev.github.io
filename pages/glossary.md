### A {#A}



: **[Advanced Basic](advanced-basic.html)** : Quality TI-Basic programming that is not only efficient in terms of size and speed, but is used to make genuinely fun games.

: **AI** : An abbreviation for artificial intelligence. Commonly used when referring to an opponent in a game that is not another player.

: **[Ans](ans.html)** : The last answer that was stored in the calculator. The calculator also keeps a history of the last few statements entered in on the home screen where general  usage of the calculator occurs.

: **Application (*App*)** : A specialized assembly program that is stored in [Flash](#flash) ROM and is run through the APPS menu. There are ten 16KB pages available for Flash Applications on the TI-83+, while there are ninety-four 16KB pages available for Flash Applications on the TI-83+SE.

: **Archive (*Arc*)** : Moving a variable or program from RAM to Flash ROM (or just ROM). Archive is the permanent memory (also known as ROM) on the TI calculator. If your calculator crashes, all of your files in RAM will be lost, while everything in the archive will still be intact.

: **Array** : A collection of numeric [variables](#variable) arranged in a [list](#list) or [matrix](#matrix) for processing by the calculator. Each element in an array is referenced by its [index](#index) - position in the array.

: **ASCII** : The American Standard Code of Information Interchange. It uses 1 [byte](#byte) (8 [bits](#bit)) to hold a [character](#character), and thus is limited to 256 different characters. The calculator uses a modified version of ASCII internally to store characters, but the TI-Basic interpreter deals with tokens instead.

: **[Assembly](assembly.html) (*Asm*)** : The other programming language built-in to the TI graphing calculators, apart from [TI-Basic](#tibasic).
