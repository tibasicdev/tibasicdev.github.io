# Summary Graphics
1. Creating graphics is done on the <u>graph screen</u>, not the home screen.
1. On the graph screen, locations are given either as <u>point</u> or <u>pixel</u> coordinates.
1. Pixel coordinates start with (0,0) at the top left corner, like on the homescreen, but increment in individual pixels.
1. Point coordinates depend on the <u>window</u> dimensions.
1. You can adjust the window dimensions by manipulating the <u>window variables</u> and/or by using the <u>zoom</u> commands.
1. You can also use the <u>format</u> commands to turn the axes off and other related things.
1. You can save the window dimensions, format options, and other related things in a <u>GBD</u>. (Graph Database)
1. Once you have the graph screen set up, you can draw on it using the <u>draw</u> commands.
1. You can erase the graph screen with the <u>ClrDraw</u> command, and you can save what is on the graph screen in a <u>Pic</u>.(Picture)
1. Unfortunately Pics can only store the <u>entire screen</u>.  They also don't force pixels that are already black to become white; sometimes this can be a good thing.
1. One particularly creative and effective way to create sprites is known as the <u>text sprite</u> method.This involves <u>overlapping</u> text to create sprites quickly.
