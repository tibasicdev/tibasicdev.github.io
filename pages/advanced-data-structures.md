# Advanced Data Structures
Data structures are methods of holding data within a program. Several data structures are built in to the calculator's operating system, such as [matrices](matrices.html) and [lists](lists.html). However, the data structures list on this page are more complicated, due to the fact that they must be made by the programmer his or herself and that they are a more complex way of holding data than the standards.

## Data Structures

The main types of data structures are:

- [Stacks](stack.html)
- [Queues](queue.html)
- [Dictionaries](dictionary.html)
- [Heaps](heap.html)
