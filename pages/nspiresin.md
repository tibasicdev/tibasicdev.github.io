`sin(θ)` returns the [Sine](https://www.mathworld.wolfram.com/sine.html) of θ
[Unlike its TI-83/84 counterpart](sin.html) which can only be a real number, or a list thereof, the nSpire version can also be used on complex numbers, as well as a list/matrix of complex numbers.

`sin(` is affected by the document angle setting

On CAS calculators<sup>(CAS only or non-CAS as well?)</sup>, `sin(θ)` can result in exact representations if θ is a value such as $\pi/3$
