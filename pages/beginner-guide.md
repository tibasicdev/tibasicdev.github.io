**TI-BASIC** is a rich programming language that can be used to create programs from the tediously simple to the outrageously complex. While playing these games is fun, one the most intellectually stimulating and rewarding things you can do is actually program these programs. If you own a TI-83 calculator or higher, you have everything you need to start programming your own TI-BASIC programs.
