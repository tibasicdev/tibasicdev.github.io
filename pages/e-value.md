# The e Command

`*e*` is a constant on the TI-83 series calculators. The constant holds the approximate value of [Euler's number](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html), fairly important in calculus and other higher-level mathematics.

The approximate value, to as many digits as stored in the calculator, is 2.718281828459...

The main use of `*e*` is as the base of the exponential function [`e^(`](e-exponent.html) (which is also a separate function on the calculator), and its inverse, the natural logarithm [`ln(`](ln.html). From these functions, others such as the trigonometric functions (e.g. [`sin(`](sin.html)) and the hyperbolic functions (e.g. [`sinh(`](sinh.html)) can be defined. In [`re^θi`](re-thetai.html) mode, `*e*` is used in an alternate form of expressing complex numbers.

Important as the number `*e*` is, nine times out of ten you won't need the constant itself when using your calculator, but rather the `e^(` and `ln(` functions.
