The ▶Rad command is used to convert both degrees and gradians into radians. (If the command is given a value in radians it returns that value unchanged).

If you do not specify what unit you want to be used (using either the [[[68k:radian|r command]]], the [[[68k:degree|° command]]], or the [[[68k:gradian|G command]]]), whatever default the calculator's mode is set to will be used. Here are some examples:

[[code]]
:setMode("ANGLE", "DEGREE")
:90▶Rad
           1
:90^r▶Rad
           90
[[/code]]

It appears to be equivalent to the ^^[[[68k:radian|r]]]^^ command, but only on the TI-89 Titanium or Voyage 200.
