The {{eval(}} command, given an expression that evaluates to a real number, returns the string representation of that number.

[[code]]eval(1337       //returns "1337"

eval(2.0-3.0    //returns "‾1"

eval(.0001234   //returns "1.234ᴇ‾4"
[[/code]]


{{eval(}} has more limitations than the {{[[[toString(]]]}} command. It cannot handle lists, matrices, or complex numbers (even when the imaginary part of the complex number is zero). Another difference from {{toString(}} is that {{eval(}} is unaffected by display mode changes like {{[[[Fix]]]}}.

+ Advanced Uses

Use {{eval(}} in conjunction with {{[[[expr(]]]}} to evaluate a real expression in a string and return the answer in a string.

[[code]]
3.14->X
eval(expr("2X+3
//returns "9.28"
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown when the expression contains a list, matrix, imaginary number, or string.
* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown when trying to evaluate a command that doesn't return a value.
