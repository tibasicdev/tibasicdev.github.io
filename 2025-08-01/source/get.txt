The {{Get(}} command is meant for use with the CBL (Calculator Based Laboratory) device, or other compatible devices. When the calculator is connected by a link cable to such a device, {{Get(//variable//)}} will read data from the device and store it to //variable//. Usually, this data is a list, and so you want to {{Get(L₁)}} or some other list variable.

+ Advanced Uses

In fact, the {{Get(}} command can also be used for linking two calculators, in which case it functions precisely like {{[[[GetCalc(]]]}}. This is probably for compatibility with the TI-82, which used {{Get(}} rather than {{GetCalc(}} for linking two calculators. However, since this isn't a documented feature (in fact, your TI-83+ manual will insist that {{Get(}} **cannot** be used in this way), it isn't guaranteed to work with future calculator versions.

+ Optimization

Nevertheless, using {{Get(}} instead of {{GetCalc(}} will make your program smaller, and probably preserve functionality.

+ Norland Robot
The {{Get(}} command is usually used after a {{[[[Send]]]}} command to confirm its transmission like this: {{Get(//var//)}}. The variable in the parentheses is where the time of the robot's movement is stored. You can display the time moved with a {{[[[Disp]]]}} command.
