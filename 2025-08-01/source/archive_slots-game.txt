description: 'Simple slots game that took me 1 week to make. It uses 20 programs total, 19 sub programs, 2 custom lists, and adds and takes away coins. If your 1m+ coins disappear, dont worry! They were just stored in the second list so that the coin count wont overflow into the next row. I will post updates for the program as well, so stay tuned!'
