The {{IndpntAuto}} setting sets the independent variable (X, T, θ, or //n// depending on [[[graphing mode]]]) to be filled in automatically in the table (which is accessible by pressing 2nd TABLE, or from a program with the {{[[[DispTable]]]}} command).

The values which will be filled in start at the value {{[[[system-variables#window|TblStart]]]}} and increment by {{ΔTbl}}(which can be negative, but not 0). They will also be stored in the list {{TblInput}}. All these variables can be accessed through the VARS|6:Table... menu; {{TblStart}} and {{ΔTbl}} can also be edited in the [2ND][TBLSET] menu.

The other possibility for this setting is {{[[[IndpntAsk]]]}} - if that setting is turned on, you must scroll to the corresponding row in the independent variable column, and enter a value.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if {{ΔTbl=0}}.
