|summary=The mathematical symbol //i//, short for √(-1).
|syntax=//i//

To enter a complex number:

//real-part//+//imag-part i//
|location=Press 2nd //i// to paste //i//.

]]

The //i// symbol is short for √(-1), and is used for complex numbers in algebra and complex analysis. On the calculator, entering //i// will not cause an error, even in [[[real-mode|Real]]] mode, but operations that result in a complex number (such as taking the square root of a negative number) will. If you're dealing with complex numbers, then, it's best to switch to [[[a+bi]]] or [[[re-thetai|re^θi]]] mode.

+ Advanced Uses

By using //i// in a calculation, the calculator switches to complex number mode to do it, even if in [[[real-mode|Real]]] mode. So √(-1) will throw an [[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]], but √(0//i//-1) will not (even though it's the same number). This can be used to force calculations to be done using complex numbers regardless of the mode setting -- usually by adding or subtracting 0//i//, although more clever ways can be found. 

A good example of this technique is our [[[Quadratic Formula]]] routine.
