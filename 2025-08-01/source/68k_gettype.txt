The getType() command returns the type of a variable -- number, string, function, etc. The output is a short string encoding the type of the variable.

[[code]]
:5→x
:getType(x)
           "NUM"
:{1,2,3}→x
:getType(x)
           "LIST"
:DelVar x
:getType(x)
           "NONE"
[[/code]]

The specific values that getType() can return are:

* "DATA" for a data variable
* "EXPR" for a symbolic expression
* "FUNC" for a function
* "LIST" for a list
* "MAT" for a matrix
* "NONE" for an undefined variable
* "NUM" for a number
* "OTH" for an unknown variable type (usually assembly-related)
* "PIC" for a picture
* "PRGM" for a program
* "STR" for a string
* "TEXT" for a text file

Keep in mind that getType() cannot test the type of an expression, only a variable -- so getType("Hello!") for example is invalid.

+ Advanced Uses

If possible, avoid comparing the result of getType() to an actual string. The risk here is that when the calculator is switched to a different language, the output of getType() changes language too. This is only a minor consideration. But if you already //have// a variable of the right type lying around, and you want to test an unknown variable, compare their getTypes(). For example:

[[code]]
:{1,2,3}→knownlst
:If getType(unknown)="LST"

can be

:{1,2,3}→knownlst
:If getType(unknown)=getType(knownlst)
[[/code]]

This is occasionally, but not always, a size optimization as well, if the known variable has a short name.

------

Since getType() returns a result even for undefined variables, it can be used as a replacement for [[[68k:isVar()]]], which unlike getType() isn't present on all 68k calculator models.
