description: "The Asm84CEPrgm command for OS 5.3.1.0058 and higher. TI restricted use on on-calculator made assembly programs on the TI-84+CE. But there is a workaround for this problem.\n\n++ How to run assembly programs\nSend this program to your calculator.\nType in the hex code in a blank program, with the assembly command already recalled. Use the [[[AsmComp(]]] command to compress your code into another program. Run the compressed code in the second program with the [[[Asm(]]] command or run it normally like a BASIC program. Running any uncompressed assembly programs will __not__ work."
