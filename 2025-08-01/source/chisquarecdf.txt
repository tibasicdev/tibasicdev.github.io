{{χ²cdf(}} is the χ² cumulative density function. If some random variable follows a χ² distribution, you can use this command to find the probability that this variable will fall in the interval you supply.

The command takes three arguments. //lower// and //upper// define the interval in which you're interested. //df// specifies the degrees of freedom (choosing one of a family of χ² distributions).

+ Advanced Uses

Often, you want to find a "tail probability" - a special case for which the interval has no lower or no upper bound. For example, "what is the probability x is greater than 2?". The TI-83+ has no special symbol for infinity, but you can use {{E99}} to get a very large number that will work equally well in this case ({{E}} is the decimal exponent obtained by pressing [2nd] [EE]). Use {{E99}} for positive infinity, and {{-E99}} for negative infinity.

The {{χ²cdf(}} command is crucial to performing a χ² goodness of fit test, which the early TI-83 series calculators do not have a command for (the {{[[[chisquare-test|χ²-Test(]]]}} command performs the χ² test of independence, which is not the same thing, although the manual always just refers to it as the "χ² Test"). This test is used to test if an observed frequency distribution differs from the expected, and can be used, for example, to tell if a coin or die is fair.

The [[[goodness-of-fit|Goodness-of-Fit Test]]] routine on the [[[routines]]] page will perform a χ² goodness of fit test for you. Or, if you have a TI-84+/SE with OS version 2.30 or higher, you can use the {{[[[chisquaregof-test|χ²GOF-Test(]]]}} command.

+ Formulas

As with other continuous distributions, we can define {{χ²cdf(}} in forms of the probability density function:

[[math]]
\operatorname{\chi^2cdf}(a,b,k) = \int_a^b \operatorname{\chi^2pdf}(x,k)\,dx
