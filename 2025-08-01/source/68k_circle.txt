The {{Circle}} command allows a person to draw a circle on the graphscreen. It can be drawn using the given keystrokes, or it can be called at the homecreen by typing it out.

Circle 0,0,5 
//Will draw a circle with a center of (0,0) and a radius of five.

+ Advanced Uses
The {{Circle}} command is based off of the window settings, so depending on how they are set up, it could draw a circle or an ellipse.
+ Command Timing
Unlike the {{Circle}} command from the 83+ family of calculators, the {{Circle}} command is very fast, drawing it almost instantly to the graphcreen, as demonstrated by the screenshot.
