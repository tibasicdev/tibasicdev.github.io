The / (divide) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions and divides them, thus returning a single new value. The / operator appears higher in the order of operations than both [[[add|+]]] and [[[subtract|-]]], so if those appear in an expression, / will be executed first. In addition, the [[[multiply|*]]] operator has the same order of operations as /, so the calculator simply executes them left to right in the order that they appear.
