normalpdf( is the normal (Gaussian) probability density function. 

Since the normal distribution is continuous, the value of normalpdf( doesn't represent an actual probability - in fact, one of the only uses for this command is to draw a graph of the normal curve. You could also use it for various calculus purposes, such as finding inflection points. 

The command can be used in two ways: normalpdf(//x//) will evaluate the standard normal p.d.f. (with mean at 0 and a standard deviation of 1) at //x//, and normalpdf(//x//,//μ//,//σ//) will work for an arbitrary normal curve, with mean //μ// and standard deviation //σ//. 

+ Formulas

For the standard normal distribution, normalpdf(//x//) is defined as
[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{normalpdf}(x)=\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\,}} \, e^{-\frac1{2}x^2}
]]

For other normal distributions, normalpdf( is defined in terms of the standard distribution:
[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{normalpdf}(x,\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma} \, \operatorname{normalpdf} \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
]]
