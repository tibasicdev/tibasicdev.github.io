The 1-PropZInt( command calculates a confidence interval for a proportion, at a specific confidence level: for example, if the confidence level is 95%, you are 95% certain that the proportion lies within the interval you get. The command assumes that the sample is large enough that the normal approximation to binomial distributions is valid: this is true if, in the sample you take, the positive and negative counts are both >5.

The 1-PropZInt( command takes 3 arguments. The first, //x//, is the positive count in the sample. The second, //n//, is the total size of the sample. (So the sample proportion is equal to //x// out of //n//). The third argument is the confidence level, which defaults to 95.

The output gives you a confidence interval of the form (a,b), meaning that the true proportion π is most likely in the range a<π<b, and the value of //x/////n//.

+ Sample Problem

You want to know the proportion of students at your school that support a particular political candidate. You take a random sample of 50 students, and find that 22 of them support that candidate. 22, the positive count, and 50-22=28, the negative count, are both >5, so the assumption is satisfied.

Using 22 for //x//, and 50 for //n//, you decide to find a 95% confidence interval. The syntax for that is:
[[code]]
:1-PropZInt(22,50,95
which can also be
:1-PropZInt(22,50,.95
[[/code]]
The output if you run the above code will look approximately like this:
[[code]]
1-PropZInt
 (.30241,.57759)
 p=.44
 n=50
[[/code]]
This tells you that between about 30.2% and about 57.8% of the students at your school are in support of the political candidate.

+ Optimization

If the confidence level is 95%, you can omit the final 95, since that is the default value:

[[code]]
:1-PropZInt(22,50,95
can be
:1-PropZInt(22,50[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if the sample proportion is not between 0 and 1, any argument is negative, or the confidence level is 100 or more.
