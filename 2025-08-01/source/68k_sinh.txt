The sinh() command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicSine.html hyperbolic sine] of a number. 

As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], sinh() can be used with complex numbers according to the rule that sinh(**//i//**x)=sin(x)***//i//** and sin(**//i//**x)=sinh(x)***//i//**. This rule only works in radian mode, and sinh() of a complex number will return a domain error when working in degrees or gradians.

Occasionally, sinh() can compute an exact result; most of the time, the calculator will leave an expression with sinh() alone unless it's in approximate mode (or you [[[68k:approx|force an approximation]]]). When sinh() is used with symbolic expressions, the calculator can go back and forth between the sinh() expression and its exponential equivalent.

If sinh() is applied to a list, it will take the hyperbolic sine of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The sinh() of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the hyperbolic sine of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.

+ Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic sine is given in terms of exponents:

[[include inc:68k-math eqn=\sinh{x} = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}]]
