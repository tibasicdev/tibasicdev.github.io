The prod( command calculates the product of all or part of a list. 

When you use it with only one argument, the list, it multiplies all the elements of the list. You can also give it a bound of //start// and //end// and it will only multiply the elements starting and ending at those indices (inclusive).

[[code]]
prod({1,2,3,4,5})
    120
prod({1,2,3,4,5},2,4)
    24
prod({1,2,3,4,5},3)
    60
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

If the value of //end// is the last element of the list, it can be omitted: 
[[code]]
prod({1,2,3,4,5},3,5)
can be
prod({1,2,3,4,5},3)
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** if the starting or ending value aren't positive integers.
* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** if the starting or ending value exceed the size of the list, or are in the wrong order.
