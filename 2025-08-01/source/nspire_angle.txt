The **angle(** command computes the angle of a complex number, which corresponds to the rotation of a vector whose length is equivalent to the **[[[nspire:abs|abs(]]]** of the number. The angle is returned in degrees, gradians, or radians, depending on the mode the calculator is in.

[[code]]
Degree mode
:angle(1+i) = 45
Radian mode
:angle(1+i) = π/4
[[/code]]

**angle(** can also return the angles for a list or matrix of complex numbers, returning the outputs in a list or matrix respectively. **angle(** will attempt to return a closed-form expression for the value rather than a decimal expression when utilizing the CAS, and can also return a symbolic evaluation of an angle.

[[code]]
:angle(z) = π(sign(z)-1)/2

+ Formulas

The general formula for the angle of complex number //x+iy// is given by

[[include inc:nspire-math eqn = \mathrm{angle}(x+iy) = \dfrac{\pi \times \mathrm{sign}(y)}{2} - \tan^{-1}\bigg(\dfrac{x}{y}\bigg)]]

Often denoted as θ, the angle of a complex number is used in its polar representation

[[include inc:nspire-math eqn = x+iy = re^{i\theta}]]

where //r// is the absolute value of the number.
