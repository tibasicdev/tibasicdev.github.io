Together with {{[[[ExecLib]]]}}, {{OpenLib(}} is used on the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus SE for running routines from a Flash App library. This only works, of course, with libraries that have been specifically written for this purpose. The only such library so far is [*http://usb8x.sourceforge.net/ usb8x], for advanced interfacing with the USB port.

The following program, which displays the version of usb8x, is an example of how to use {{OpenLib(}} and {{ExecLib}}:
