The {{GraphStyle(}} command allows you to set the graphing style of an equation (line, thick line, dotted line, etc.) from within a program.

Its first argument, //equation #//, is the number of the equation whose graphing style you want to change - this depends on the mode you're in. For example, if you wanted to change the graphing style of Y,,1,,,  you would need to be in [[[func|function]]] mode and use the value 1 for this argument. If you wanted to change the graphing style of r,,4,,, you would need to be in [[[polar-mode|polar]]] mode and use the value 4.

The second argument is a number from 1 to 7, which translates to a graphing style as follows:
* 1 - a normal line, usually the default graph style.
* 2 - a thick line (three pixels wide).
* 3 - a line, with everything above it shaded (only valid in function mode).
* 4 - a line, with everything below it shaded (only valid in function mode).
* 5 - a path: a line, with a ball moving along it as it is graphed (not valid in [[[seq-mode|sequential]]] mode).
* 6 - animated: a ball moving along the graph (not valid in sequential mode).
* 7 - a dotted line.

Compare this to the effect of {{[[[Connected]]]}} or {{[[[Dot]]]}} mode. When either of these modes is set, all equations, from all graphing modes, are reverted to line style or dotted line style respectively; furthermore, it becomes the default graph style and clearing an equation will revert it to this graph style. The {{GraphStyle(}} command simply overrides these modes temporarily.

+ Advanced

In shading modes (3 and 4), the shading style cycles as follows:
* The first function graphed shades using vertical lines one pixel apart
* The second function shades using horizontal lines one pixel apart
* The third function shades using negatively sloping diagonal lines, two pixels apart.
* The fourth function shades using positively sloping diagonal lines, two pixels apart.
* After that, functions will cycle through these four styles in that order.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** if the //equation #// is not a valid equation number in this mode, or if //style #// is not an integer 1-7.
* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** if the graphing style chosen is not valid for the current graphing mode.
