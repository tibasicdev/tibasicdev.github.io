[*http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/359/35907.html xLIB] is a TI-83+/84+/SE assembly application created by [*http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/82/8279.html Patrick Prendergast (tr1p1ea)], and it adds additional functionality to TI-Basic programs. It works by installing a parser hook which will intercept any [[[real-func|real(]]] command requests.

Some of its features include:

* Fast sprites/tilemapping
* Faster key routines
* Scrolling the screen
* Executing archived programs

+ Documentation

Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of documentation that has been created for xLIB. The three main pieces of documentation that have been created so far include the [[[xlib-readme|readme]]] file itself, a [[[xlib-tutorial|tutorial]]] heavily based on the readme, and a [[[xlib:masked-sprites|masked sprites]]] tutorial explaining how to use xLIB to create masked sprites. We can hopefully create more documentation at some point in the future.
