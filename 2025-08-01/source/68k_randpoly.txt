The randPoly() command generates a random polynomial. randPoly(//var//,//deg//) generates a random polynomial in variable //var// of degree //deg//. The coefficients of each power of //var// are random integers from -9 to 9.

:RandSeed 0
:randPoly(x,5)
           4*x^5-2*x^4-7*x^2+8*x+8

+ Advanced Uses

Using the [[[68k:RandSeed]]] command makes the resulting polynomial entirely predictable: every time you set the random seed to some variable, you will get the same random coefficients afterwards. Also see RandSeed for details of how random numbers are generated.

+ Error Conditions

[[include inc:68k-error num=260|error=Domain error|cause=the value of //deg// is not between 0 and 99]]
