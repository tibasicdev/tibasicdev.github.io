R►Pθ( (Rectangular to polar θ) takes the (//x//,//y//) (Cartesian) coordinate, and returns the angle that the ray  from (0,0) to (//x//,//y//) makes with the positive x-axis. This is the θ-coordinate of the same point in (//r//,//θ//) (polar) mode. The identity used for this conversion is tan(//θ//)=//y/////x//, with the correct inverse being chosen depending on the quadrant that the point is in. The range of the angle returned is -π<//θ//≤π. R►Pθ( can also be used on lists.

R►Pθ( is equivalent to the atan2() instruction seen in C/++ and FORTRAN.

R►Pθ( is affected by [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] and [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] mode in its output, which is an angle measured in degrees or radians respectively.

+ Advanced Uses

If you want the result to always be a radian angle, regardless of mode settings, you can divide the result by 1^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^:
[[code]]
R►Pθ(x,y)/1^^r

If you want the result to always be a degree angle, regardless of mode settings, you can divide the result by 1[[[degree-symbol|°]]]:
[[code]]
R►Pθ(x,y)/1°
