description: "This is a Mario game made pretty much in pure BASIC (except for an asm snippet to fix the bug with the Text() command, grr). Featuring 6 worlds, 5 enemy types, animated coin blocks, and MUCH more, this is a truly must-have for your calculator if you are at all interested at gaming. It is the first BASIC Mario game of its size (~14,000 bytes) and has good looking graphics on top of that. Yahoo! All instructions are included in the readme.\n\n"
