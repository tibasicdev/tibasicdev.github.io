description: 'This program is intended for teachers or anyone who wants to grade tests or exams. It is one of the first programs that I have written, but it is constantly being improved. Version 3.5 has a better user interface, and improved control. This version is designed to work with the standard grading scale(eg. 100-93: A, 92-85: B, etc.), but for states with different grading scales, contact me. Email me at macperson84 AT mac DOT com.'
