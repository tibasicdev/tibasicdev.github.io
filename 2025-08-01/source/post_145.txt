content: "I am going through and optimising some of your code and I can tell a bunch of it was well thought out :D\nThere are a handful of common optimisations that I can suggest:\n\n* Instead of using ~L+32 (I am assuming ~ is negative), you can use 32-L to save a byte\n* You can drop ending quotes and parentheses\n* To elaborate on what Silver said, DelVar is two bytes, so 0→Q is the same size as DelVar Q. However, [[[DelVar ]]] and the other memory functions have a cool trick where you don't need to use a newline for the next command, saving a byte! For example, instead of this:\n[[code]]\n0→Q\n1→P\n---or---\nDelVar Q\n1→P\n[[/code]]\n(both are the same size) You can do this:\n[[code]]\nDelVar Q1→P\n[[/code]]\nWhich is one byte less and essentially does the same thing.\n* [[[Disp ]]] has a cool trick like [[[Text(]]] where each additional argument is treated like a new Disp. For example:\n[[code]]\nDisp \"YOU LOSE...\"\nDisp \"YOUR SCORE:\"\n[[/code]]\nCan instead be:\n[[code]]\nDisp \"YOU LOSE...\",\"YOUR SCORE:\n[[/code]]\nPretty neat, right?\n* One random trick optimisation was with this line:\n[[code]]\nIf G=72 and Y-L+32≠1\n[[/code]]\nI changed it in my head to:\n[[code]]\nIf G=72 and Y-L+32-1\n[[/code]]\nWhich can be optimised to save two bytes:\n[[code]]\nIf G=72 and Y-L+31\n[[/code]]\nI am weird, so my methods are awkward. If you want to do the more logical version of my solution:\n[[code]]\nIf G=72 and Y-L+32≠1\n---use some algebra---\nIf G=72 and Y-L+32-32≠1-32\nIf G=72 and Y-L≠~31\n---get rid of that negtive sign, it is using an unnecessary byte D: ---\nIf G=72 and Y-L+L≠~31+L\nIf G=72 and Y≠L-31\n[[/code]]\nYay :3 (I am in a math optimisy mood, sorry).\n* Often [[[Repeat ]]] is more useful than While (in my opinion) because you don't need to set the variables before the loop. When I started learning TI-BASIC, I actually never learned what [[[While ]]] did until I joined this site and saw people using it. I just found Repeat and figured out how it worked and I like it .-.\nHere is how I convoluted it:\n[[code]]\nDelVar CDelVar P\"      ;6 spaces here\nMenu(Ans+\"PONG\"+Ans,\"TWO PLAYER\",2,\"PRACTICE\",P,\"CHALLENGE\",C,\"QUIT\",Q\nLbl C\n1→C\n2→U\nLbl P\n1→P\nLbl 2\nDelVar VDelVar WDelVar SDelVar T4→L\n32→O\n48→N\nDelVar EDelVar Q1→D\nStoreGDB 0\n1→Xmin\n95→Xmax\nFnOff \nAxesOff\nClrDraw\nIf C or P\nThen\nVertical 1\nVertical 2\nEnd\nHorizontal (-)10\nHorizontal 10\nFor(I,1,93,92\nFor(J,32-L,L+32,1\nPxl-On(J,I\nEnd\nEnd\nRepeat Q\ngetKey→G\nIf G\nThen\nIf G=72 and Y-L+31\nThen\nY-1→Y\nPxl-On(Y-L+32,1\nPxl-Off(Y+L+33,1\nElse\nIf G=92 and Y+L≠29\nThen\nY+1→Y\nPxl-On(Y+L+32,1\nPxl-Off(Y-L+31,1\nElse\nIf G=45\nThen\nClrHome\nDisp \"GAME PAUSED\",\"[ENTER]: RESUME\",\"[CLEAR]: QUIT\nRepeat 30=abs(Ans-75\ngetKey\nEnd\nIf Ans=45\n1→Q\nElse\nIf G=74 and T-L+31\nThen\nT-1→T\nPxl-On(T-L+32,93\nPxl-Off(T+L+33,93\nElse\nIf G=94 and T+L≠29\nThen\nT+1→T\nPxl-On(T+L+32,93\nPxl-Off(T-L+31,93\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nN→A\nO→B\nIf N=1 or N=93\nThen\nIf not(C\nThen\nClrHome\nIf N=1\nV+1→V\nIf N=93\nW+1→W\nDisp \"LEFT SCORE:\nOutput(1,13,V\nDisp \"RIGHT SCORE:\nOutput(2,14,W\nPause \nIf V>9\nThen\nDisp \"LEFT WINS!\n1→Q\nEnd\nIf W>9\nThen\nDisp \"RIGHT WINS!\n1→Q\nEnd\n32→O\nDelVar E48→N\nElse\nClrHome\nDisp \"YOU LOSE...\",\"YOUR SCORE:\nOutput(2,13,U\nIf U>|LPONG(1\nU→|LPONG(1\nDisp \"HIGH SCORE:\nOutput(3,13,|LPONG(1\nPause \n1→Q\nEnd\nEnd\nIf pxl-Test(O,N+D\nThen\nIf C and U>2\nThen\nVertical U-1\nVertical U\nU+1→U\nEnd\n~D→D\nElse\nIf pxl-Test(O+1,N+D\nThen\n~1→E\nIf N=2 or N=92\nThen\n~D→D\nIf C\nThen\nVertical U-1\nVertical U\nU+1→U\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nIf pxl-Test(O-1,N+D\nThen\n1→E\nIf N=2 or N=92\n~D→D\nEnd\nEnd\nO+E→O\nN+D→N\nPxl-Off(B,A\nPxl-On(O,N\nEnd\nLbl Q\nRecallGDB 0\nClrHome\n[[/code]]\nI gave it a try and I like how you implemented the two player mode. Also, should the pixel be moving at an angle or just back and forth? If you want, I can put together a simple Pong engine so that you can compare it :D"
