The Line( command is used to draw lines at any angle, as opposed to only drawing [[[vertical]]] or [[[horizontal]]] lines. Line(X,,1,,,Y,,1,,,X,,2,,,Y,,2,,) will draw a line from (X,,1,,,Y,,1,,) to (X,,2,,,Y,,2,,). Line( is affected by the window settings, although you can use a [[[friendly-window|friendly window]]] so there is no impact on the command.

:Line(5,5,20,3)

+ Advanced Uses

Line has an optional fifth argument. It can be any real number, but the default is one. If the fifth argument, //erase//, is something other than 0, then it will simply draw the line. If //erase// is 0, then it will erase the line.

[[code]]
:Line(5,5,20,3,0)
[[/code]]

Leave off the ending argument if you are just drawing the line.

[[code]]
:Line(5,5,20,3,1)
can be
:Line(5,5,20,3)
[[/code]]

The ending argument can be a formula, which is useful for [[[movement|movement applications]]] and other things such as health bars where the lines drawn are constantly different. The following draws or erases a line depending on whether a key is pressed.

[[code]]
:getKey
:Line(5,5,20,3,not(Ans
[[/code]]

If working on a TI 84+CSE or TI 84+CE, then the fifth argument of the Line( command can be a color name or ID number:

[[code]]
:Line(5,5,20,3,BROWN
[[/code]]


The last argument, line style, is an optional argument that chooses what style of line to draw on the color calculators.

[[code]]
1 pixel wide line
:Line(5,5,20,3,RED,1
2 pixel wide line
:Line(5,5,20,3,RED,2

:Line(5,5,20,3,RED,3
shaded below
:Line(5,5,20,3,RED,4

+ Command Timings

If you are drawing horizontal or vertical lines that stretch the entire graph screen, such as a border, it is better to use [[[Vertical]]] or [[[Horizontal]]]. These are smaller and are usually faster as well.
