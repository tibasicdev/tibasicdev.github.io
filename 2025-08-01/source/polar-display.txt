The ►Polar command can be used when displaying a complex number on the home screen, or with the [[[Disp]]] and [[[Pause]]] commands. It will then format the number as though [[[re-thetai|re^θi]]] mode were enabled. It also works with lists.

[[code]]

	i
i►Polar
	1e^(1.570796327i)
{1,i}►Polar
	{1 1e^(1.570796327i)}
[[/code]]

It will also work when displaying a number by putting it on the last line of a program by itself. It does **not** work with [[[Output(]]], [[[Text(]]], or any other more complicated display commands.

To actually separate a number into the components of polar form, use [[[abs(]]] and [[[angle(]]].
