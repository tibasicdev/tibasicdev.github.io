sin(θ) returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html sine] of θ, which is defined as the y-value of the point of intersection of the unit circle and a line containing the origin that makes an angle θ with the positive x-axis

The value returned depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] mode. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°.  The conversion from radians to degrees is angle*180/π and from degrees to radians is angle*π/180.  The sin( command also works on a list of real numbers.

In radians:
[[code]]
sin(π/6)
	.5
[[/code]]

In degrees:
[[code]]
sin(30)
	.5
[[/code]]


+ Advanced Uses

You can bypass the mode setting by using the [[[degree-symbol|°]]] (degree) and ^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^ (radian) symbols. These next two commands will return the same values no matter if your calculator is in degrees or radians:
[[code]]
sin(30°)
	.5
[[/code]]
[[code]]
sin(π/6ֿ¹)
	.5
[[/code]]
