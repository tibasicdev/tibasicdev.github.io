The {{tan()}} command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tangent.html tangent] of an angle measure. Naturally, the result depends on the angle {{[[[68k:setmode|mode]]]}} the calculator is in: {{radian}}, {{degree}}, or (in AMS version 3.10) {{gradian}}. You can also use one of the {{^^[[[68k:radian|r]]]^^}}, {{[[[68k:degree|°]]]}}, {{^^[[[68k:gradian|G]]]^^}} marks to specify an angle mode.

For many common angles, {{tan()}} can compute an exact result. Other angles, the calculator will leave alone unless it's in approximate mode (or unless you make it approximate), and then it will give a decimal approximation. As long as the calculator is in {{radian}} [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{tan()}} can be used with complex numbers as well.

If {{tan()}} is applied to a list, it will take the tangent of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The {{tan()}} of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the tangent of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.
