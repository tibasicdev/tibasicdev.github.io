The iPart() command returns the integer part of a number (removing all the digits after the decimal). Another way of thinking about it is it rounds a number towards 0: positive numbers get rounded down to an integer, and negative numbers get rounded up to an integer.

There are several other rounding commands available, which work in subtly different ways:
* [[[68k:ceiling()]]] always rounds up to the next higher integer.
* [[[68k:floor()]]] always rounds down to the next lower integer. [[[68k:int()]]] does the same thing as [[[68k:floor()]]].
* [[[68k:round()]]] rounds to any given place value, including to an integer; it rounds up or down, whichever is nearest. 

However, iPart() is the only one that has a counterpart [[[68k:fPart()]]] which returns the fractional part of a number. This follows the rule that iPart(x)+fPart(x) always equals x.

Using iPart() on the result of a division -- iPart(x/y) -- is useful so often that there's a specific command, [[[68k:intDiv()]]], for doing so. 

iPart() can also be applied to complex numbers, lists, and matrices, rounding everything that there is to round in each of them.
