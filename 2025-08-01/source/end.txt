The {{End}} command is used together with the different control structures, including the {{[[[If]]]}} conditional, {{[[[While]]]}} loop, {{[[[Repeat]]]}} loop, and {{[[[For(]]]}} loop, to indicate the //end// of the code block for the respective control structure. In the case of the {{If}} conditional, you also need to add a {{[[[if|Then]]]}} command, which is used to indicate the beginning of the control structure.

+ Advanced Uses

You can prematurely end a control structure by using a single {{If}} conditional and then having {{End}} be its executed command. Because the calculator stores the positions of the {{End}} commands, it will take this {{End}} command to be the {{End}} command of the control structure.

[[code]]
:If <condition>
:End
[[/code]]

One of the most important features of the {{End}} command is putting multiple control structures inside of each other (known as nesting). While you typically nest {{If}} conditionals inside of loops, you can actually nest any control structure inside of any other control structure -- this even works when using the same control structure, such as a {{While}} loop inside of another {{While}} loop.

When nesting control structures, you need to remember to put the appropriate number of {{End}} commands to close the appropriate structure. The easiest way to keep track of lots of nested control structures is to code the first part, add an {{End}} immediately after the beginning, and then hit 2nd DEL on the line with the {{End}}, then hit ENTER a lot of times.
