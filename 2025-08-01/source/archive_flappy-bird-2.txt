summary: 'A remake of the previously uploaded game [[[archive:flappy-bird|Flappy Bird]]].'
description: "This is a remake of the previously uploaded game [[[archive:flappy-bird|Flappy Bird]]] which features a more intuitive design which allows users to change the speed, and makes the input easier. The code was completely rewritten, and has been tested. It now appears to be bug-free. **If it does not work when you enter it into your calculator, make sure you have entered __everything__ correctly! This code has been proven to work by either the download or the source code.**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\nClick [*https://youtu.be/pqpcVcU0tb4 here] to see a video of me using the download to prove it is functional.\nClick [*https://youtu.be/hphE8dH1UmI here] to see a video of me using the source code to prove it is funtional.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nTo change the speed, change the first line of the program. A lower number stored into D will make the program faster, higher numbers will make it slower. D must be at least 1. \n\nSource Code: [[footnote]]The character @<\"//\">@ indicates a comment on how to type the code.
