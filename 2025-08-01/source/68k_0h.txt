The calculator can work with numbers written in three bases: decimal (the usual), binary, and hexadecimal. The 0h command indicates that a number is written in [[[68k:glossary#hexadecimal|hexadecimal]]]:
[[code]]
:0h10
           16
:0h2F6
           758
[[/code]]

When written in hexadecimal, numbers are expressed as signed 32-bit integers (32 bits correspond to 8 hexadecimal digits), which means that only the integers between -2^^31^^ and 2^^31^^-1 can be expressed in hexadecimal. With other hexadecimal-related commands, numbers are simply truncated to fit in this range. Not so with 0h: if you enter more than 8 hexadecimal digits after the 0b, the result is a domain error.

Even if the calculator is in hexadecimal mode, you still have to write 0h for an integer to be interpreted as hexadecimal: the mode setting only affects output. If the calculator is in decimal mode, which is the default, you have to use [[[68k:▶Hex]]] to get output in hexadecimal.
