The {{Func}} command enables the default [[[graphing-mode#function|function]]] graphing mode. This command is usually unnecessary in a program, but if you want to graph a Y= equation, you'd want to make sure the calculator is in function mode first.

In function mode, you can graph equations where //y// (the vertical coordinate) is a function of //x// (the horizontal coordinate). This mode is most commonly discussed in algebra and single-variable calculus courses. Many curves, such as a parabola, have simple expressions when written in the form //y=f(x)//.

However, in function mode, many expressions cannot be graphed at all. For example, a circle can't be easily graphed in function mode, since for some //x//-values, there are two //y//-values. Using two functions, you can achieve a circle, but it will still require a friendly graphing window to display perfectly.

Many calculator features are specifically targeted at function mode graphing. For example, two graphing styles (see {{[[[GraphStyle(]]]}}) can be only used with function mode. The {{[[[DrawF]]]}} and {{[[[DrawInv]]]}} commands draw functions as if in graphing mode.

+ Advanced Uses

The [[[system-variables#window|window variables]]] that apply to function mode are:

* {{Xmin}} -- Determines the minimum X-value shown on the screen.
* {{Xmax}} -- Determines the maximum X-value shown on the screen.
* {{Xscl}} -- Determines the horizontal space between marks on the X-axis in {{[[[AxesOn]]]}} mode or dots in {{[[[GridOn]]]}} mode.
* {{Ymin}} -- Determines the minimum Y-value shown on the screen.
* {{Ymax}} -- Determines the maximum Y-value shown on the screen.
* {{Yscl}} -- Determines the vertical space between marks on the Y-axis in {{AxesOn}} mode or dots in {{GridOn}} mode.
* {{Xres}} -- Determines the pixel distance between points used for graphing. This is a value 1-8: 1 for best quality, 8 for best speed.
