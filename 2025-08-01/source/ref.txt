Given a matrix with at least as many columns as it has rows, the {{ref(}} command uses a technique called Gaussian elimination to put the matrix into row-echelon form.

This means that the leftmost N columns (if the matrix has N rows) of the matrix are upper triangular - all entries below the main diagonal are zero. What's more, every entry on the main diagonal is either 0 or 1.

+ Advanced Uses

In theory, a system of linear equations in N variables can be solved using the {{ref(}} command - an equation of the form [[$ a_1x_1+\dots + a_nx_n = b $]] becomes a row [[$ a_1, \dots, a_n, b $]], and is put into the matrix. If there is a sufficient number of conditions, the last row of the reduced matrix will give you the value of the last variable, and back-substitution will give you the others.

In practice, it's easier to use {{[[[rref(]]]}} instead for the same purpose.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if the matrix has more rows than columns.
