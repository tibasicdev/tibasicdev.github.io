summary: 'A program that asks for a DNA or RNA sequence, then gives the complementary sequence and displays it!'
description: "This quick little program can generate a complementary DNA/RNA sequence for DNA/RNA, and then displays the result. In color!\n\nCurrently functional - it works if you 'play by the rules.' Invalid characters will crash the program, and the display looks strange if you have too small of a sequence.\n\nPlanned: \n1.0 - Main release, character check, will include key on diagram (what color is what base)\n1.0/1.1 - Optimizations and bugfixes, a readme that is 'slightly' helpful (instructions that are mostly self explanator)\n\nTo install, just send the file ACTG.8xp to your TI-84+CSE or TI-84+CE."
