description: 'This is the optimized version of my previous quadratic program. The functions are the same, but there are no errors and it is much more compact. This is a program where you input A,B, and C and it calculates the vertex of the parabola and then the roots (if any). If there are two roots they all be listed, if there is one root, it will be listed twice. If there are no roots, you will get imaginary numbers. As well as calculating these values, it also graphs the equation (stored into Y1). This is not shown in the program, but can be viewed after exiting. The program also includes a list of equation forms and a square root finder for calculating discriminants. It does not require anything other than a few variables to run. The program is not locked.'
