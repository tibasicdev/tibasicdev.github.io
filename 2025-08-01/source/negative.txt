The ‾ (negative) operator takes one number, variable, or expression and negates its value, thus returning the negative equivalent of it. The ‾ operator appears higher in the order of operations than both the [[[operators#relational|relational]]] and [[[operators#logical|logical]]] operators, so it will be executed first. In addition, it has the same order of operation as the other [[[operators#math|math]]] operators, so the calculator simply executes them left to right in the order that they appear.

[[code]]
:‾1
           -1

:5→X
:‾3(X+2
           -21

:‾2→A:‾3→B
:AB
           6

+ Optimization

When adding a negative number to a positive number, switch the two numbers around and change the addition to subtraction. This allows you to get rid of the ‾ sign and save a byte.

[[code]]
:‾A+B→C
can be
:B-A→C
[[/code]]
This is not always the case, however: if you subtract a command that uses a lot of parentheses and is followed by a newline/colon/STO→ arrow, it'd save space to put the subtraction at the beginning of the line. For instance:
[[code]]
:inString(Ans,sub(Str1,1,1+int(log(A))))-1
can be
:‾1+inString(Ans,sub(Str1,1,1+int(log(A
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

If an **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is being thrown near a subtraction or negation where there should be no errors, check to make sure that ‾ (negation) and - (subtraction) were not swapped by mistake.
