summary: 'This is a program where you input A,B, and C and it calculates the vertex of the parabola and then the roots (if any).  As well as calculating these values, it also graphs the equation (stored into Y1). This is not shown in the program, but can be viewed after exiting. The program also includes a list of equation forms and a square root finder for calculating discriminants. '
description: 'This is a program where you input A,B, and C and it calculates the vertex of the parabola and then the roots (if any). If there are two roots they all be listed, if there is one root, it will be listed twice. If there are no roots, ERR:NONREAL ANS comes up. Simply press enter twice from here to resume the program. As well as calculating these values, it also graphs the equation (stored into Y1). This is not shown in the program, but can be viewed after exiting. The program also includes a list of equation forms and a square root finder for calculating discriminants. It does not require anything other than a few variables to run. They are deleted after the program is finished. The program is not locked, to the best of my knowledge.'
