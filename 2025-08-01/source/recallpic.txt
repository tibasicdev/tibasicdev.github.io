{{RecallPic}} draws a saved picture to the graph screen (to save a picture, draw it on the graph screen, then save it with {{[[[StorePic]]]}}). If something is already drawn on the graph screen, {{RecallPic}} will draw new pixels where needed, but it will not erase anything. As a result, you often want to {{[[[ClrDraw]]]}} before recalling a picture.

The number passed to {{RecallPic}} must be one of 0 through 9. It has to be a number: {{RecallPic X}} will not work, even if X contains a value 0 through 9.

+ Advanced Uses

A combination of {{StorePic}} and {{RecallPic}} can be used to maintain a background over which another [[[glossary#s|sprite]]] moves:

# Draw the background, and save it to a picture file with {{StorePic}}.
# Next, draw the sprite to the screen.
# When you want to move the sprite, erase it, then use {{RecallPic}} to draw the background again.
# Then draw the sprite to its new location on the screen again (this can be done before or after using {{RecallPic}}).

Also, if a screen in your program takes more than a second to draw, and is displayed several times, you might want to consider storing it to a picture the first time it's drawn, and then recalling it every next time you want to draw it.
