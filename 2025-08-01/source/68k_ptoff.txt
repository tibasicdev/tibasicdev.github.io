The PtOff command erases a point on the graph screen. It uses point coordinates, which means that the result is determined by [[[68k:system-variables#window|window variables]]]: the x-coordinate must be between xmin and xmax, and the y-coordinate must be between ymin and ymax (with (xmin,ymin) being the bottom left and (xmax,ymax) the top right corner).

Unlike pixel commands such as [[[68k:PxlOff]]], however, PtOff won't give an error if the coordinates happen to be outside these bounds -- it simply won't have any effect.

+ Advanced Uses

PtOff can also be used with two lists of the same size. In that case, it will erase the points for every pair of elements (xlist[n], ylist[n]).
