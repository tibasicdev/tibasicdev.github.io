In most cases, .* does the same thing as [[[68k:multiply|*]]]. The difference only applies to multiplying two matrices. Whereas * uses the linear-algebra definition (see its article for details), .* does the simple thing and multiplies the matrices element by element (obviously, they must match in size for this to work). 

[[code]]
:[1,2;3,4] .* [a,b;c,d]
        [a    2*b]
        [3*c  4*d]
