With the {{IndpntAsk}} setting, the independent variable (X, T, θ, or //n// depending on [[[graphing mode]]]) will not be calculated automatically in the table. Instead, when looking at the table, you must select an entry in the independent variable column, press ENTER, and enter a value. The values entered will also be stored to the {{[[[system-variables#window|TblInput]]]}} list.

(To access the table, press [2ND][TABLE], or use the {{[[[DispTable]]]}} command in a program)

The alternative, {{[[[IndpntAuto]]]}}, fills in several values starting at {{TblStart}} and increasing by {{ΔTbl}}, and makes the table scrollable (up and down).
