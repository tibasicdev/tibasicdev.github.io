The - (subtract) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions and subtracts one from the other, thus returning the difference between them. The - operator appears lower in the order of operations than both [[[multiply|*]]] and [[[divide|/]]], so if those appear in an expression, they will be executed first. In addition,  the [[[add|+]]] operator has the same order of operations as -, so the calculator simply executes them left to right in the order that they appear.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown if you try to use - (subtract) in place of [[[negative|‾]]] (negative). Because they look very similar, it's easy to get this error; at the same time, it's an easy error to fix.
