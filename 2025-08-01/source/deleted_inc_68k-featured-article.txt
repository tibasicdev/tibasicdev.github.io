"[[[68k:Sprites]]]" are small images displayed as part of a larger scene on the screen. In TI-68k Basic, support for sprites is built-in, in the form of picture variables.

The most common reasons to use a sprite are to display a picture which will be moved around on the screen, or repeated multiple times as part of a pattern ([[[68k:sprites|more...]]])

"[[[68k:Tokenization]]]" is the process whereby the characters that make up a command are replaced by a token -- a number representing the command.

Since the size of the program is determined by its tokenized size, understanding this process is key to optimization, at least for size. ([[[68k:tokenization|more...]]])
