The > (greater than) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions, and tests to see if the first one has a value greater than the second one. It will return 1 if it is greater, and 0 if it is not. When determining the order of operations, > will be executed after the [[[operators#math|math]]] operators, but it will be executed before the [[[operators#logical|logical]]] operators and in the order that it appears from left to right with the other [[[operators#relational|relational]]] operators.

+ Advanced Uses

Just like the other relational operators, > can take real numbers and lists for variables. In order to compare the lists, however, both must have the same dimensions; if they don't, the calculator will throw a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error. When comparing a real number to a list, the calculator will actually compare the number against each element in the list and return a list of 1s and 0s accordingly.

[[code]]
:{2,4,6,8}>{1,3,5,7
           {1 1 1 1}
:5>{1,2,3,4,5
           {1 1 1 1 0}

Unfortunately, > does not work with strings, matrices, or complex numbers (only [[[equal|=]]] and [[[notequal|≠]]] do), and the calculator will actually throw a [[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]] error if you try to compare them. In the case of strings, however, it should be pretty obvious why: a string represents a sequence of characters, and does not associate a value to any character, so there is nothing to compare.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you try to compare strings, matrices, or complex numbers.
* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if you try to compare two lists that have different dimensions.

+ Related Commands

* [[[equal|=]]] (equal)
* [[[notequal|≠]]] (not equal)
* [[[greaterthanequal|≥]]] (greater than equal)
* [[[lessthan|<]]] (less than)
* [[[lessthanequal|≤]]] (less than equal)
