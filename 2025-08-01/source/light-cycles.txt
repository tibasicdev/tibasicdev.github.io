If you remember the old movie, //Tron//, you might remember the premise of this game.  You control a cycle (or in this case, a pixel) that moves in a direction until you change the direction.  It leaves a path, and if you hit the path, or the wall, you lose.  The trick here is that you must out last your opponent: an AI.  This version of Light Cycles for the calculator utilizes a simple AI system that makes it kind of intelligent.  Please try to understand the code and learn from it.
