When the {{DependAuto}} setting (opposed to the {{[[[DependAsk]]]}} setting) is turned on, values in the table are automatically calculated. With {{[[[IndpntAuto]]]}}, that means the table is automatically filled out completely; with {{[[[IndpntAsk]]]}}, that means that as soon as you enter a value for the independent variable, all the values of the dependent variables are calculated. This is usually the setting you want to use.
