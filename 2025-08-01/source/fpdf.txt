{{Fpdf(}} is the //F//-distribution probability density function. 

Since the //F//-distribution is continuous, the value of {{Fpdf(}} doesn't represent an actual probability - in fact, one of the only uses for this command is to draw a graph of the distribution. You could also use it for various calculus purposes, such as finding inflection points. 

The command takes 3 arguments: //x// is the point at which to evaluate the function (when graphing, use X for this argument), //numerator df// and //denominator df// are the numerator degrees of freedom and denominator degrees of freedom respectively (these specify a single {{Fpdf(}} curve out of an infinite family).

The //F//-distribution is used mainly in significance tests of variance.

+ Formulas

The value of the {{Fpdf(}} is given by

[[math]]
\operatorname{Fpdf}(x,d_1,d_2) = \frac{\left( \frac{d_1x}{d_1x+d_2} \right)^{d_1/2} \left(1-\frac{d_1x}{d_1x+d_2}\right)^{d_2/2}}{x \operatorname{B}(d_1/2,d_2/2)}
[[/math]]

where //B(x,y)// is the [wikipedia:beta_function Beta function].
