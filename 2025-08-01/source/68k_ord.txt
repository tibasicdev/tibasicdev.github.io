The ord() command gives the ASCII code of a character (that is, its [[[68k:character-codes|character code]]], which is a modification of standard ASCII). The input is meant to be a single character, but the command doesn't actually check for that -- so in practice, it gives the ASCII code of the first character in a string. You can convert multiple characters at once by giving ord() a list (or matrix) of characters.

The inverse of ord() is [[[68k:char()]]], which converts a character code to a character.

[[code]]
:ord("America")
           65
:ord({"A","b","c"})
           {65  98  99}
:ord("")
           0
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

Code such as
[[code]]
:inString("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",str)
[[/code]]
should be replaced by appropriate use of ord(); in this case,
[[code]]
:ord(str)-64
[[/code]]
