When applied to a list or a string, right(//x//,//length//) gets the last (right-most) //length// elements/characters of //x//. 

When applied to an equation (such as x=5) or an inequality (such as x<3), right() returns the right-hand side of the equation. This only works for equations that don't get simplified: right(2+2=4) will not work, because 2+2=4 will return 'true' first.

[[code]]
:right({1,2,3,4,5},3)
           {3  4  5}
:right("TI-Basic Developer",9)
           "Developer"
:right(x^2+2x+1>0)
           0
:right({1,2,3,4,5},0)
           {}
