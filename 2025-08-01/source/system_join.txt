When you are first learning TI-Basic, having the content of this wiki available to you to learn from and read through is a valuable resource. A lot of time and effort from others has been put into it to make it something worthwhile for the TI-Basic community, so once you are up to speed with TI-Basic, please consider giving something back to the site.

There are many different ways you can contribute:

* **Promote the site** — Tell others about the site to drive traffic to the wiki. If you frequent any forums, you can post a badge with a link to the wiki in your signature on the forums. We have created four different badges that you can choose from:
 * [[image /home/tibasicdevsig.png]] — http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/home/tibasicdevsig.png
 * [[image /home/tibasicdevsig2.png]] — http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/home/tibasicdevsig2.png
 * [[image /home/tibasicdevsig3.png]] — http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/home/tibasicdevsig3.png
 * [[image /home/tibasicdevsig4.png]] — http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/home/tibasicdevsig4.png
* **Create new content** -- New tutorials and articles are always welcome, and help the wiki to keep growing. A tutorial doesn't need to be a polished, ten page guide, just something that teaches a new technique or discusses a new idea.
* **Cleanup existing pages** -- There are several pages on the wiki which haven't been edited in a long time, and they are in need of editing to add in missing information and correct errors.
* **Post on the forum** -- When somebody posts on the [[[forum:home|forum]]] asking for help, you should try to help them to the best of your abilities. Similarly, you should try to post regularly to keep the forum from becoming stagnant.

Currently, you cannot contribute anonymously to this wiki, because we would like to get to know you better and you can become part of our community. In addition, members of this wiki have complete permission access, so they can edit any content, upload files, and communicate and collaborate fully. Who wouldn't want that?
