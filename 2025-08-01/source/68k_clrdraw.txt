The {{ClrDraw}} command clears away anything drawn on the graph screen -- that is, the result of any of the [[[68k:graphics]]] commands, except for {{[[[68k:Graph]]]}} (which you can only clear with {{[[[68k:ClrGraph]]]}}). It also leaves alone any functions or plots (which are disabled by {{[[[68k:FnOff]]]}} and {{[[[68k:PlotsOff]]]}}, respectively), as well as axes, labels, a grid, etc. (which can be disabled by the {{[[[68k:setGraph()]]]}} command).

Be warned that it doesn't update the screen. For example, if you run the following program:
[[code]]
:circ()
:Prgm
:Circle 0,0,5
:ClrDraw
:EndPrgm
[[/code]]
it will draw a circle and then end on the graph screen with the circle still drawn. The screen will actually update the next time you change something on the graph screen; you can also use {{[[[68k:DispG]]]}} to update it (although in the program above, {{[[[68k:DispHome]]]}} might be more appropriate).
