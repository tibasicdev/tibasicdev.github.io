The InputStr command allows you to input a string to a variable. Since [[[68k:Input]]] doesn't support the storing of strings into variables, you have to use this command to do that. Keep in mind that the inputted variable cannot be the name of a preexisting variable or flash application that is locked, protected, or archived. For example, if you had a program named "a" or "hello", the command wouldn't work because it is already in use.
[[code]]
InputStr A
//Here, you would a string to be stored to the variable A

InputStr hello
//This would store the string into the variable "hello".
