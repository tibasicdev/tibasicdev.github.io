This command is used to determine the length of a string. Unlike the [[[dim(]]] command for lists and matrices, it cannot be used to change this length, as there is no null character for strings (the null value is 0 for lists and matrices).

[[code]]
:length("HELLO
	5
[[/code]]

Keep in mind that the length is measured in the number of tokens, and not the number of letters in the string. For example, although the sin( command contains 4 characters ("s", "i", "n", and "("), it will only add 1 to the total length of a string it's in. The execution time for length( is directly proportional to the length of the string.

+ Advanced Uses

The code for looping over each character (technically, each token) of a string involves length(:

[[code]]
:For(N,1,length(Str1
...
use sub(Str1,N,1 for the Nth character
...
:End
[[/code]]
