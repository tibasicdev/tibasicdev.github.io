content: "I have finished the [[[board:_main|New Forum System]]] enough for testing.  Please see how you like it!\n\nA few things you will notice:\n* You cannot preview a post.  This is due to the Wikidot coding I'm using.  However, sacrificing this functionality means being able to make attachments and having the integrated char box.\n* The syntax buttons do not show anymore.  All of the relevant styling can be found [[[post:48|here]]].\n* Everyone has the member type \"Member Type\".  I still haven't quite figured out how I want to code this; it isn't easy.\n* I'm still figuring out how this is going to affect unregistered users (sorry Boba Foxx...), but I have ideas on making it work.\n\nPlease provide feedback so the system can better fit the needs of the community."
