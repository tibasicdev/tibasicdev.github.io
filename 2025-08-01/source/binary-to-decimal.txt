This routine takes a positive whole binary number (base 2), expressed as a list, and converts it to the equivalent decimal (base 10) representation. To express a binary number in a list, you simply put commas in between each digit, and then surround that with list brackets. For example, the binary number 101101 expressed a list would be {1,0,1,1,0,1}. To learn how to convert a binary number to a decimal number, vice versa, and even see how to convert to and from other bases besides binary and decimal, see the [[[binandhex|Binary and Hexadecimal]]] page.

It also may be important to note that adding 0’s to the front of a binary number will not change the decimal equivalent. For example, both 0110101,,2,, and 110101,,2,, are equivalent to 53,,10,,. 

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if the list has an imaginary number in it. 
* An error will not be thrown the list is not a binary number, or if any element in the list is negative or non-whole. Nonetheless, the conversion will not work correctly.
