reason: 'I suspect that this is Thel Vadamee'
proof: 'His writing style, for one. Also, the fact that he would create two threads before even introducing himself. Lastly, the fact that he tried to make a program in the archives that had something to do with "Breath of the Wild" (check the Recent Changes page, you''ll see what I mean), which pretty strongly links Bio_Hazard1282 to Thel Vadamee''s "brother" account(s). If the Moderators and Administrators feel differently, however, I will respect their decision.'
