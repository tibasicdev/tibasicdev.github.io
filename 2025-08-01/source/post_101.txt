It just draws the menu and you can move the selector thing. I need to add in scrolling for menus that are too large for one screen and I need to add in the ability to open sub-menus and then I can start going through the catalog and making tutorials XD\n\nAnother neat idea that I thought of doing was maybe if you are in a menu (like the Math menu) and you want to see how a command works, you can press ON and it starts the appropriate tutorial."
