{{Horizontal Y}} draws a vertical line from the left of the graph screen to the right at //Y//. {{Horizontal}} is usually only used to replace a line that stretches the entire length of the graph screen, along with its counterpart {{[[[Vertical]]]}}.

{{Horizontal}} is affected by the window settings, unlike the {{[[[pxl-on|Pxl-]]]}} commands.

+ Advanced Uses

One of the fastest ways to make the entire screen black is by drawing horizontal lines from the bottom of the screen to the top.

If working with TI 84+C version calculators, the {{Horizontal}} command takes an additional color argument, as shown below:
