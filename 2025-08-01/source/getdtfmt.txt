The {{getDtFmt(}} command returns the current date format of the clock on the TI-84+/SE/CE calculators as an integer. There are three different date formats available: 1 (M/D/Y), 2 (D/M/Y), and 3 (Y/M/D). You can store this value to a [[[variables|variable]]] for later use. Of course, this command only works if the date format has actually been set, so you should use the {{[[[setDtFmt(]]]}} command before using it.
