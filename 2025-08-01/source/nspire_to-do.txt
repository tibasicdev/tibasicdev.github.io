[[tab Incomplete Pages]]
* All of the pages over at Code Examples are virtually content-less. If someone has any particular requests for routines and such, add them here.
* [[[nspire:timings|]]] needs more comparisons: any requests?
* [[[nspire:variable-names|]]] is finished, but it needs to be put somewhere for people to find.
* Add more pages similar to [[[nspire:list-optimization|]]] and link to them from [[[nspire:optimization|]]].

[[tab Commands Needed]]

Here's a step-by-step process for writing a command page if you'd like to help. Skip any step you don't understand rather than struggling with it -- some info is better than none.

# Title of the page should be "The ---- Command"
# Start with the nspire command stub.
# Change the picture name to the name of the page, in lowercase, followed by .png -- this will find the screenshot.
# To easily find the location, check the third tab of the command index.
# To easily find the command size, go to http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/estack.html and find the command.
 * Start with 1 byte since all commands take at least that.
 * If it's under the ExtTags or InstructionTags heading, add a byte.
 * If the syntax on the left has [ ] brackets at all (which usually means optional arguments) add a byte.
 * There are exceptions to this, but I think I've already documented them all.
# If you don't know what to write, check similar commands. Actually, check them anyway.
# If you don't know everything about the command, writing something still is better than no page at all.
# To figure out the errors a command can cause, scroll down [[[nspire:errors|the list]]] and see if any apply.
# Add the category (command index, second tab) of the command as a parent. If it's in several, pick one.
# Tag it with 'command', every category it belongs to, and anything else that seems important.

A bunch of commands have a screenshot attached to that command's page. These don't serve any purpose, since the screenshots the page actually uses are attached to [[[nspire:command-index]]]. These ought to be deleted sometime, although this isn't urgent: if you do it, you'll get snaps from me, but I'm personally holding out for an update to the wiki software that will let me delete them all at once.
