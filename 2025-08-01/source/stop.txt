When the Stop command is used in a program it exits the program (terminating the program execution) and returns you to the home screen. If it is encountered within [[[controlflow|loops]]], the loops will be stopped.

There is some distinction when using Stop with [[[subprograms]]]: the Stop command will stop the program execution of the subprogram, as well as the calling program, and return you to the home screen; the program will stop completely. If this functionality is not desired, then you should use the [[[Return]]] command instead.

+ Optimization

You don't have to put a Stop command at the end of a program or subprogram if you can organize the program so that it just naturally quits. When the calculator reaches the end of a program, it will automatically stop executing as if it had encountered a Stop command (the Stop is implied).
