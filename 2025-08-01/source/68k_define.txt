The {{Define}} command sets the value of a variable. At its simplest, it's an alternative to {{[[[68k:store|→]]]}}: {{Define}} x=5 is equivalent to 5→x. However, {{Define}} is also useful for defining functions or programs using {{[[[68k:Func]]]}}..{{EndFunc}} or {{[[[68k:Prgm]]]}}..{{EndPrgm}} respectively, which {{→}} can't do:

[[code]]
:Define key()=Func
: Local k
: Loop
:  getKey()→k
:  If k≠0
:   Return k
: EndLoop
:EndFunc
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

Using {{Define}} to create functions or programs is very useful when inside a program. If your program uses its own subroutines to perform simple tasks (such as the key-reading program above), you can define these subroutines inside the program itself, keeping everything in one file (it might be good to make them {{[[[68k:Local]]]}} or use {{[[[68k:DelVar]]]}} to delete them afterwards). Subroutines are useful for organizing a large program.
