The {{lock}} command prevents a variable's value from changing. In programs and functions, {{lock}} is usually used to stop a variable from undesirably changing. If a variable is universally defined (like files in folders), the {{lock}} command has a popular purpose of making the variable constant (unchanging) throughout use in sets of programs.

[[code]]
input "Input var1 here: ",var1
lock var1
text "You can no longer change var1."
© var1 can now be used as a constant variable.
©... <program statements that require the value of var1>
prgm2() ©var1 may not change in any other programs.
unlock var1
[[/code]]
Note: the © command will turn any code written until the next ':' into comments. (neat-freaks love this.)
Comments are very helpful for people who forget, especially when dealing with tricky commands and code. Using comments for the //lock// command will help you remember to //unlock// the variable when the time comes to delete it.
