The √() command takes the square root of a value: √(x) is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives x. It's a special case of the [[[68k:power|^]]] and [[[68k:root()]]] commands: √(x) = x^(1/2) = root(x,2).

Unless the calculator is in approximate [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], or you force it to approximate (by pressing ♦+ENTER, or using [[[68k:approx()]]]), it won't try to evaluate all square roots: it will take the square root of perfect squares, otherwise, it will just take out all the square factors (for instance, √(20) is simplified to 2√(5)).

For positive numbers, √() will return the positive square root; more generally, if the result is complex (and if the calculator is in complex number mode), the result of √() will be the one with non-negative real part.

If the square root of a list is taken, it will take the square root of every element of the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The √() of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the square root of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.
