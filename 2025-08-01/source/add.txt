The + (add) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions and adds their values together, thus returning a single new value. The + operator appears lower in the order of operations than both [[[multiply|*]]] and [[[divide|/]]], so if those appear in an expression, they will be executed first. In addition,  the [[[subtract|-]]] operator has the same order of operations as +, so the calculator simply executes them left to right in the order that they appear.

+ Advanced Uses

The + operator is overloaded (meaning it has more than one function) by the calculator, and it can be used to put [[[strings]]] together. The strings can consist of whatever combination of text and characters that you want, but it unfortunately does not allow you to join a string to a number (i.e., "Hello5" cannot be made with "Hello"+5).
