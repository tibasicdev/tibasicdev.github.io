The {{Degree}} command puts the calculator into Degree mode, where the inputs and/or outputs to trig functions are assumed to be degree angles.

Angles measured in degrees range from 0 to 360, with 0 being an empty angle, 90 being a right angle, 180 being a straight angle, and 360 being a full angle all the way around a circle.

To convert from a radian angle to a degree angle, multiply by 180/π. To go the other way, and get a radian angle from a degree angle, multiply by π/180.

The following commands are affected by whether the calculator is in {{[[[radian-mode|Radian]]]}} or {{Degree}} mode:

The input is differently interpreted:
* {{[[[P►Rx(]]]}}, {{[[[P►Ry(]]]}}
* {{[[[sin(]]]}}, {{[[[cos(]]]}}, {{[[[tan(]]]}}

The output is differently expressed:
* {{[[[angle(]]]}}
* {{[[[r-ptheta|R►Pθ(]]]}}
* {{[[[arcsin|sin‾¹(]]]}}, {{[[[arccos|cos‾¹(]]]}}, {{[[[arctan|tan‾¹(]]]}}
* {{[[[polar-display|►Polar]]]}} (and complex numbers when in {{[[[re-thetai|re^θi]]]}} mode)
* {{^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^}}, {{[[[degree-symbol|°]]]}}

However, some commands are notably unaffected by angle mode, even though they involve angles, and this may cause confusion. This happens with the {{[[[SinReg]]]}} command, which assumes that the calculator is in {{Radian}} mode even when it's not. As a result, the regression model it generates will graph incorrectly in {{Degree}} mode.

Also, complex numbers in polar form are an endless source of confusion. The {{angle(}} command, as well as the polar display format, are affected by angle mode. However, complex exponentials (see the {{[[[e-exponent|e^(]]]}} command), defined as [[$ e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta $]], are evaluated as though in Radian mode, regardless of the angle mode. This gives mysterious results like the following:
[[code]]
Degree:re^θi
		Done
e^(πi)
		1e^(180i)
Ans=e^(180i)
		0 (false)
[[/code]]

Overall, it's better to put your calculator in {{Radian}} mode when dealing with polar form of complex numbers, especially since no mathematician would ever use degrees for the purpose anyway.

+ Optimization

It's sometimes beneficial to use the {{[[[degree-symbol|°]]]}} symbol instead of switching to {{Degree}} mode. The ° symbol will make sure a number is interpreted as a degree angle, even in {{Radian}} mode, so that, for example:

[[code]]
Radian
		Done
sin(90)
		-.8011526357
sin(90°)
		1
[[/code]]

This is smaller when only one trig calculation needs to be done. Also, it doesn't change the user's settings, which are good to preserve whenever possible.
