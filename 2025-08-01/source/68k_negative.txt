The ‾ operator gives the negative of the value immediately following it. It's not to be confused with the [[[68k:subtract|-]]] operator, which subtracts two numbers -- while on paper you'd generally use the same symbol for -2 and 4-2, the calculator has two different symbols, and negation is represented by the slightly shorter and higher dash.

You can also use ‾ to negate lists and matrices, which will negate each element, as expected.

Other pages on this site will use - to mean both subtraction and negation, where it isn't confusing.
