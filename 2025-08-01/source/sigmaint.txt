The {{ΣInt(}} command calculates, for an [wikipedia:Amortization_schedule amortization schedule], the interest over a range of payments: the portion of those payments that went toward paying interest. Its two required arguments are //payment1// and //payment2//, which define the range of payments we're interested in. However, it also uses the values of the finance variables {{PV}}, {{PMT}}, and {{I%}} in its calculations.

The optional argument, //roundvalue//, is the number of digits to which the calculator will round all internal calculations. Since this rounding affects further steps, this isn't the same as using {{[[[round(]]]}} to round the result of {{ΣInt(}} to the same number of digits.

Usually, you will know the values of **N**, {{PV}}, and {{I%}}, but not {{PMT}}. This means you'll have to use the finance solver to solve for {{PMT}} before calculating {{ΣInt(}}; virtually always, {{FV}} will equal 0.

+ Sample Problem

//Imagine that you have taken out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The loan amount is $100000, and the annual interest rate (APR) is 8%. Payments will be made monthly. How much of the amount that was paid in the first five years went towards interest?//

We know the values of **N**, {{I%}}, and {{PV}}, though we still need to convert them to monthly values (since payments are made monthly). **N** is 30*12, and {{I%}} is 8/12. {{PV}} is just 100000.

Now, we use the finance solver to solve for {{PMT}}. Since you intend to pay out the entire loan, {{FV}} is 0. Using either the interactive TVM solver, or the {{[[[tvm|tvm_Pmt]]]}} command, we get a value of about -$733.76 for {{PMT}}.

We are ready to use {{ΣInt(}}. We are interested in the payments made during the first five years; that is, between the 1^^st^^ payment and the 5*12=60^^th^^ payment. {{ΣInt(1,60)}} gives us the answer: -$39095.73 (the negative sign simply indicates the direction of cash flow)

+ Formulas

{{ΣInt(}} is calculated in terms of {{[[[sigmaprn|ΣPrn(]]]}}, for which a recurrence exists. Since the total amount paid during an interval is known (it's the payment size, multiplied by the number of payments), we can subtract {{ΣPrn(}} from this total to get {{ΣInt(}}:

\operatorname{\Sigma Int}(n_1,n_2)=(n_2-n_1+1)\operatorname{PMT}-\operatorname{\Sigma Prn}(n_1,n_2)

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if either payment number is negative or a decimal.
