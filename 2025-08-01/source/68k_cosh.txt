The {{cosh()}} command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicCosine.html hyperbolic cosine] of a number. 

As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{cosh()}} can be used with complex numbers according to the rule that cosh(**//i//**x)=cos(x) and cos(**//i//**x)=cosh(x). This rule only works in radian mode, and {{cosh()}} of a complex number will return a domain error when working in degrees or gradians.

Occasionally, {{cosh()}} can compute an exact result; most of the time, the calculator will leave an expression with {{cosh()}} alone unless it's in approximate mode (or you [[[68k:approx|force an approximation]]]). When {{cosh()}} is used with symbolic expressions, the calculator can go back and forth between the {{cosh()}} expression and its exponential equivalent.

If {{cosh()}} is applied to a list, it will take the hyperbolic cosine of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The {{cosh()}} of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the hyperbolic cosine of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.

+ Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic cosine is given in terms of exponents:

[[include inc:68k-math eqn=\cosh{x} = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}]]
