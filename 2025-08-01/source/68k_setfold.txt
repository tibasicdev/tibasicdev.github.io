This command is used to set the current folder. The folder must exist, otherwise the function produces an error. This is a way around this error:

[[code]]
:example()
:Prgm
:Try
:setFold(fold1)
:Else
:ClrErr
:NewFold(fold1)
:EndTry
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses
If you are changing the current folder, but want to set it back later, the getFold() command is not required to store the old folder name.
For example:
[[code]]
:foldset()
:Prgm
:Local a
:getFold()→a
:setFold(fold1)
	...
:setFold(#a)
:EndPrgm
[[/code]]
does the same thing as
[[code]]
:foldset2()
:Prgm
:Local a
:setFold(fold1)→a
	...
:setFold(#a)
:EndPrgm
[[/code]]
