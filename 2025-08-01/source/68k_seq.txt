The seq() command creates a [[[68k:lists|list]]] of terms of a sequence: seq(//formula//,//variable//,//start//,//end//) evaluates //formula// for every value of //variable// from //start// to //end//. Optionally, a fifth argument, //step-size//, is included: this increases the value of //variable// by //step-size// for each element, instead of 1.

seq() is similar to a [[[68k:For]]]..EndFor loop, but instead of repeating a block of commands every time, it only evaluates a formula.

[[code]]
:seq(f(x),x,1,5)
           {f(1)  f(2)  f(3)  f(4)  f(5)}
:seq(x,x,3,9,2)
           {3  5  7  9}
:seq(x^2,x,5,1,-1)
           {25  16  9  4  1}
[[/code]]

The variable used in seq(), x in the examples, is not actually modified.

+ Advanced Uses

Because a [[[68k:matrices|matrix]]] is just a list of lists, you can use seq() to create matrices as well as lists. The simplest way to do it is to make the formula a list:
[[code]]
:seq({x,2x,3x},x,1,4)
           [1  2  3 ]
           [2  4  6 ]
           [3  6  9 ]
           [4  8  12]
[[/code]]
You can also create a matrix by nesting a seq() command inside another seq() command:
[[code]]
:seq(seq(row+col,col,1,4),row,1,3)
           [2  3  4  5]
           [3  4  5  6]
           [4  5  6  7]
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

If all you need to do in a loop is create a list, it's probably better to use seq() than [[[68k:For]]]..EndFor.

------

You can often use [[[68k:newList()]]] instead of seq() to create an expression that gets evaluated much faster (see [[[68k:list-optimization|]]] for details).

+ Error Conditions

For the non-generic errors that might occur when using this command (that is, syntax-type errors shouldn't be included). In a format similar to the following:

[[include inc:68k-error num=260|error=Domain error|cause=the //step-size// argument is 0]]
[[include inc:68k-error num=510|error=Invalid list or matrix|cause=the formula of seq() is a matrix, or a list that varies in size]]
