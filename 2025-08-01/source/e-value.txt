{{//e//}} is a constant on the TI-83 series calculators. The constant holds the approximate value of [*http://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html Euler's number], fairly important in calculus and other higher-level mathematics.

The approximate value, to as many digits as stored in the calculator, is 2.718281828459...

The main use of {{//e//}} is as the base of the exponential function {{[[[e-exponent|e^(]]]}} (which is also a separate function on the calculator), and its inverse, the natural logarithm {{[[[ln(]]]}}. From these functions, others such as the trigonometric functions (e.g. {{[[[sin(]]]}}) and the hyperbolic functions (e.g. {{[[[sinh(]]]}}) can be defined. In {{[[[re-thetai|re^θi]]]}} mode, {{//e//}} is used in an alternate form of expressing complex numbers.

Important as the number {{//e//}} is, nine times out of ten you won't need the constant itself when using your calculator, but rather the {{e^(}} and {{ln(}} functions.
