The {{coth()}} command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicCotangent.html hyperbolic cotangent] of a number. Along with 11 other trig and hyperbolic functions, it was added in AMS version 2.07; on earlier versions, {{coth(x)}} can be replaced by 1/{{tanh(x)}}.

As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], coth() can be used with complex numbers according to the rule that coth(**//i//**x)=-cot(x)***//i//** and cot(**//i//**x)=-coth(x)***//i//**. This rule only works in radian mode, and {{coth()}} of a complex number will return a domain error when working in degrees or gradians.

Occasionally, {{coth()}} can compute an exact result; most of the time, the calculator will leave an expression with {{coth()}} alone unless it's in approximate mode (or you [[[68k:approx|force an approximation]]]). When {{coth()}} is used with symbolic expressions, the calculator can go back and forth between the {{coth()}} expression and its exponential equivalent.

[[code]]
:coth(0)
           undef
:expand(coth(x))
          -1/(e^x+1)+1/(e^x-1)+1
:comDenom(1-2/((e^x)^2+1))
          1/tanh(x)
[[/code]]

If {{coth()}} is applied to a list, it will take the hyperbolic cotangent of every element in the list. However, it can't be applied to matrices the way {{tanh()}} can (this is probably an oversight; all the trig and hyperbolic functions that were present in all AMS versions work with matrices, but the ones added in version 2.07 do not).

+ Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic cotangent is, by analogy with {{[[[68k:cot()]]]}}, the ratio of {{[[[68k:cosh()]]]}} and {{[[[68k:sinh()]]]}}:

[[include inc:68k-math eqn=\coth{x}=\frac{\cosh{x}}{\sinh{x}} = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}}]]
