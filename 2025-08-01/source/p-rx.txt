P►Rx( (polar►rectangular x-coordinate) calculates the x-coordinate of a polar point.  Polar coordinates are of the form (r,θ), where θ is the counterclockwise angle made with the positive x-axis, and r is the distance away from the origin (the point (0,0)).  The conversion identity x=r*cos(θ) is used to calculate P►Rx(.

The value returned depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|degree]]] mode. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion from radians to degrees is angle*180/π and from degrees to radians is angle*π/180.  The P►Rx( command also accepts a list of points.

P►Rx(5,π/4)
	3.535533906
5*cos(π/4)
	3.535533906
P►Rx({1,2},{π/4,π/3})
	{.7071067812 1}

+ Advanced Uses

You can bypass the mode setting by using the [[[degree-symbol|°]]] (degree) and ^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^ (radian) symbols.  This next command will return the same values no matter if your calculator is in degrees or radians:
[[code]]
P►Rx(1,{π/4^^r,60°})
	{.7071067812 .5}
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

In most cases P►Rx(r,θ) can be replaced by r*cos(θ) to save a byte:

[[code]]
:P►Rx(5,π/12)
can be
:5cos(π/12)
[[/code]]

Conversely, complicated expressions multiplied by a cosine factor can be simplified by using P►Rx(r,θ) instead.

[[code]]
:(A+BX)cos(π/5)
can be
:P►Rx(A+BX,π/5)
[[/code]]
