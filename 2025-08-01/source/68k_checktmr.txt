The {{checkTmr()}} command, together with {{[[[68k:startTmr()]]]}} uses the built-in system clock to measure the time (in seconds) that passed between two points of the program. Make sure that the clock is on (with {{[[[68k:ClockOn]]]}} before using these).

The name of the commands reflects their use: you can think of a {{startTmr()}} call as creating and starting a timer:
[[code]]
:startTmr()→timer
[[/code]]

The {{checkTmr()}} command will then return the number of seconds that have elapsed on the timer (without stopping it):
[[code]]
:Disp "Seconds elapsed:",checkTmr(timer)
[[/code]]

This is a good abstraction and you don't need to know the details of how {{startTmr()}} and {{checkTmr()}} work to use them. In reality, what {{startTmr()}} actually returns is the current value of a system timer (which increases by 1 every second). The {{checkTmr()}} command does the same thing, but subtracts its parameter: so {{checkTmr(x)}} is equivalent to {{startTmr()}}-x. 

Because both {{startTmr()}} and {{checkTmr()}} deal with whole numbers of seconds, the resulting difference in time could be off by up to a second in either direction. That is, if {{checkTmr()}} gives 15 seconds as the time, you know the time that actually passed is between 14 and 16 seconds.

+ Advanced Uses

The {{startTmr()}} and {{checkTmr()}} commands can be used to figure out how much time a command or routine takes with much greater precisions by running it multiple times. For example:
[[code]]
:startTmr()→t
:For i,1,1000
: somecmd()
:Disp checkTmr(t)
[[/code]]
Suppose that the result displayed was 100 seconds. This is accurate to 1 second, so the actual time was between 99 and 101 seconds. However, this actual time is for 1000 repetitions of {{somecmd()}} (we assume that the time the code takes to increment i is negligible, although that may also be taken into account). So {{somecmd()}} repeated only once takes between 99/1000 and 101/1000 seconds, so the actual time is 100 ms, measured to within 1 millisecond error.

See [[[68k:Timings|]]] for more information on this, as well as the results of some common comparisons.
