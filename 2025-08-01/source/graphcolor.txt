The {{GraphColor(}} command will change the color of any function from {{Y,,0,,}} to {{Y,,9,,}}. So, for example, to change the color of {{Y,,3,,}} to NAVY, do:
[[code]]
GraphColor(3,NAVY
[[/code]]
Notice, you must use the number of the function, rather than the entire function name, which would be {{Y,,3,,}}.

As you may know, you can also use the value of the color, which can be any integer between 10 and 24. So, our last command could also be:
[[code]]
GraphColor(3,17
[[/code]]
