{{cos(θ)}} returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cosine.html cosine] of θ, which is defined as the x-value of the point of intersection of the unit circle and a line containing the origin that makes an angle θ with the positive x-axis

The value returned depends on whether the calculator is in {{[[[radian-mode|Radian]]]}} or {{[[[degree-mode|Degree]]]}} mode. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion from radians to degrees is angle*180/π and from degrees to radians is angle*π/180. The {{cos(}} command also works on a list of real numbers.

In radians:
[[code]]
cos(π/3)
    .5
[[/code]]

In degrees:
[[code]]
cos(60)
    .5
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

You can bypass the mode setting by using the {{[[[degree-symbol|°]]]}} (degree) and {{^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^}} (radian) symbols.  These next two commands will return the same values no matter if your calculator is in degrees or radians:
[[code]]
cos(60°)
    .5
[[/code]]
[[code]]
cos(π/3ֿ¹ )
    .5
[[/code]]
