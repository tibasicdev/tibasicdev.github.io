We will be learning about the [[[getKey]]] command, and how to create a controlled movement in this program.

++ Starting Out

There are a few steps to ensure that your program will run smoothly:

+++ Check if you have the RAM to hold a program

Click on 2nd then MEM above the + sign. Make Sure that you have at least 500 RAM too use. If you don't, I suggest you archive something by pressing 2 then 1, then press ENTER on anything that doesn't have a star next to it.

+++ Creating the program

Click the PRGM key then use the right arrow until NEW is highlighted. You should get a screen like this:

[[code]]
PROGRAM
NAME=
[[/code]]

Go ahead and enter any name you want. Must be only A-Z, no numbers.

+++ Now for the commands

Lets go ahead and put in some commands. By now you should have a general understanding so I'll go through this pretty fast:

[[code]]
PROGRAM:MOVER    // Title
:ClrHome         // Clears screen
:1→Y       // Sets 1 to Y
:1→X       // Sets 1 to X
:Lbl 1             // Program Divider #1
:Output(X,Y,"O"  // Displays the character
:getKey→G  // Gets the key that the user is pressing
:If G=0  // IF G=0 then...
:Goto 1  // Go to top (looper)
:If G≠0  // If G≠0 then...
:ClrHome  // Clears the screen
:If G=25  // If G=Up then...
:Y-1→Y  // Y-1 to Y when up is pressed
:If G=34  // If G=Down then...
:Y+1→Y  // Y+1 to Y when down is pressed
:If G=24  // If G=Left then...
:X-1→X  // X-1 to X when left is pressed
:If G=26  // If G=Right then...
:X+1→X  // X+1 to X when right is pressed
:If X=0  // If X is less than the screen then...
:X+1→X  // X+1 to X to stop ERROR:DOMAIN
:If Y=0  // IF Y is less than the screen then...
:Y+1→Y  // Y+1 to Y to stop ERROR:DOMAIN
:If X=17  // IF X is greater than the screen then...
:X-1→X  // X-1 to X to stop ERROR:DOMAIN
:If Y=9  // IF Y is greater than the screen then...
:Y-1→Y  // Y-1 to Y to stop ERROR:DOMAIN
:Goto 1  // Goes up to the top (looper)
[[/code]]

++ Result

The user will be able to move a little circle around the screen.
 
++ Conclusion

Way to go you made your first getKey program!

++ Optionals

You can make your circle teleport to the other side of the screen if you change this part of the program.

[[code]]
...
:If X=0  // If X is less than the screen then...
:X+16→X  // Move X to right side of the screen
:If Y=0  // IF Y is less than the screen then...
:Y+8→Y  // Move Y to bottom of the screen
:If X=17  // If X is greater than the screen then...
:X-16→X  // Move X to left side of the screen
:If Y=9  // If Y is greater than the screen then...
:Y-8→Y  // Move Y to top of the screen
:Goto 1  // Goes up to the top (looper)
