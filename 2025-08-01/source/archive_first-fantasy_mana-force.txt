summary: 'The first color RPG released for the TI-84 Plus CE family of calculators'
description: 'First Fantasy is one of the first RPG ever released for the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition and the first ever one for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI-83 Premium CE! The CSE version uses Doors CSE 8.1 libraries to enhance TI-BASIC language, while the CE version uses CE Textlib and a custom font. This very loose remake of Mana Force for the 83+ brings enhanced graphics, new magic spells and enemies, new cutscenes, expanded storyline and many new challenges. There are 16 magic spells available, 7 character classes, 49 monsters (79 in the CE version) and several hours of gameplay. The CE version also features bonus dungeons and treasure chests. If you are a fan of Square-Enix Japanese role-playing games such as Final Fantasy, then you should try it!'
