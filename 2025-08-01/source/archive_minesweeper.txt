summary: 'This is minesweeper written in pure BASIC, no assembly. It takes advantage of three difficulty levels and a custom dimension setter. It also keeps track of the high score (or low score, rather) for each difficulty. With easy controls and relatively fast loading times, this program is worth trying! '
