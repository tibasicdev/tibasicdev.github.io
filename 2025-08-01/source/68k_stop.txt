Simply put, the Stop command stops the program wherever it is placed. 
[[code]]
stop()
Prgm
0->X
While true
getkey()->k
x+1->x
Output 5,5,x
If k=13
Stop
EndWhile
EndPrgm
[[/code]]

This program will increase the value of x by one, but when the user presses the ENTER button, it will stop. Keep in mind to put the Stop EXACTLY where you want it to stop.
