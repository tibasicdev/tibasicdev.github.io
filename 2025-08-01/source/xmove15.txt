Xmove15 is a small, but fun puzzle game that involves moving numbers around a 4x4 board until you get them in the order 1 to 15 (with the numbers wrapping from the right edge to the left edge on the next row). You control a cursor that you use to move the numbers: put the cursor over a number next to the empty spot, and the number and the empty spot will be swapped when you press 2nd.

Just like with XprO's other quality game, [[[Xsnake]]], Xmove15 features great TI-Basic code. The game makes ample use of control structures, with a very easy to follow organization and setup, as well as showcasing several optimizations for speed and size. Simply put, it is a lot of fun to look at the underlying code, and to see what is possible in a small number of bytes.
