The ./ operator works just like [[[68k:divide|/]]] in most cases. The only exception is with matrices. The / command can't do anything with then (except for dividing a matrix by a value), but ./ will just apply the operation element-by-element. Obviously, when this is done for two matrices, their dimensions have to match up.
[[code]]
:[a,b;c,d] ./ [e,f;g,h]
           [a/e  b/f]
           [c/g  d/h]
[[/code]]

When dividing a constant number by a matrix with ./, you may need to space it out so that there's no confusion between ./ and a decimal point.
[[code]]
:1./[a,b;c,d]
           Error: Data type
:1 ./ [a,b;c,d]
           [1/a  1/b]
           [1/c  1/d]
[[/code]]
