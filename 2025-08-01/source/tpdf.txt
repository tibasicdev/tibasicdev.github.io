{{tpdf(}} is the Student's //t// probability density function. 

Since the //t// distribution is continuous, the value of {{tpdf(}} doesn't represent an actual probability -- in fact, one of the few uses for this command is to draw a graph of the bell curve. You could also use it for various calculus purposes, such as finding inflection points. 

The command takes two arguments: the first is the value where the PDF is to be evaluated, and the second is the number of degrees of freedom (so the calculator knows which //t// distribution to use). As the degrees of freedom increases without bound, {{tpdf(}} approaches {{[[[normalpdf(]]]}}; i.e.

[[math]]
\lim_{\nu\rightarrow\infty}\operatorname{tpdf}(x,\nu)=\operatorname{normalpdf}(x)

+ Formulas

The value of {{tpdf(}} is given by

[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{tpdf}(t,\nu) = \frac{\Gamma((\nu+1)/2)}{\sqrt{\nu\pi}\,\Gamma(\nu/2)}\,\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac1{2}(\nu+1)}
]]

(where Γ is the [wikipedia:Gamma_function gamma function]), or alternatively

[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{tpdf}(t,\nu) = \frac1{\sqrt{\nu}B(\nu/2,1/2)}\,\left(1+\frac{t^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac1{2}(\nu+1)}
]]

(where B is the [wikipedia:Beta_function beta function])
