xLIB xLIB Revolution is a clone of the Dance Dance Revolution game using the xLIB Flash app. Unlike most other calculator clones, this one features quality graphics and runs pretty fast. It also includes a level editor that will allow infinite possibilities for the game. You can even have background images in songs and animations. This is one of the best TI-Basic DDR clones available.
