The calculator can work with numbers written in three bases: decimal (the usual), binary, and hexadecimal. The 0b command indicates that a number is written in [[[68k:glossary#binary|binary]]]:
[[code]]
:0b101
           5
:0b100000
           32
[[/code]]

When written in binary, numbers are expressed as signed 32-bit integers, which means that only the integers between -2^^31^^ and 2^^31^^-1 can be expressed in binary. With other binary-related commands, numbers are simply truncated to fit in this range. Not so with 0b: if you enter more than 32 binary digits after the 0b, the result is a domain error.

Even if the calculator is in binary mode, you still have to write 0b for an integer to be interpreted as binary: binary mode only affects output. If the calculator is in decimal mode, which is the default, you have to use [[[68k:▶Bin]]] to get output in binary.
