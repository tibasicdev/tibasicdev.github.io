{{Shadeχ²(}} is equivalent to {{[[[chisquarecdf|χ²cdf(]]]}} in terms of the probability it calculates: if a random variable follows the χ² distribution, you can use it to calculate the probability that the variable's value falls in a certain interval. However, in addition to calculating the probability, this command also draws the χ² curve, and shades the interval whose area represents the probability you want.

Note that this command does not actually return the value it calculates in Ans or anywhere else: it's merely displayed on the graph. If you're going to use the value in further calculations, you'll have to use {{χ²cdf(}} as well.

The {{Shadeχ²(}} command takes three arguments. //lower// and //upper// identify the interval you're interested in. //df// specifies the degrees of freedom (selecting from an infinite family of χ² distributions).

Thus, the following code would find the probability of χ² between 0 and 1 on a χ² distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, and shade this interval:

:Shadeχ²(0,1,2

+ Advanced

Often, you want to find a "tail probability" - a special case for which the interval has no lower or no upper bound. For example, "what is the probability x is greater than 2?". The TI-83+ has no special symbol for infinity, but you can use {{E99}} to get a very large number that will work equally well in this case ({{E}} is the decimal exponent obtained by pressing [2nd] [EE]). Use {{E99}} for positive infinity, and {{-E99}} for negative infinity. 

It can be hard to find the best window for {{Shadeχ²(}} to work in, since it doesn't automatically zoom for you. For any number of degrees of freedom (except for 1), the graph doesn't go above y=.5 (a good value for {{[[[system-variables#window|Ymax]]]}}); {{[[[system-variables#window|Ymin]]]}} should probably be something small and negative. {{[[[system-variables#window|Xmin]]]}} should be around 0 (possibly slightly less if you like seeing axes), while {{[[[system-variables#window|Xmax]]]}} probably shouldn't go above 5.

Keep in mind that {{Shadeχ²(}} is just a drawing command and not an actual graphed function, so resizing the window, {{[[[ClrDraw]]]}}, and other commands that refresh the [[[graphscreen]]] will remove it.
