[[code]]
:N+M10^(1+int(log(N→O
[[/code]]

With our two numbers stored in M and N respectively, we add the first number to the second number by raising it to the 10^^th^^ power, with the exponent being how many digits are in the number. We then store this result to a new variable for later use.

We can figure out how many digits are in a number by using the 1+int(log( trick. This trick works with any positive whole numbers, and if you add [[[abs(]]] after [[[log(]]], it will also work with negative numbers. Unfortunately, it does not work with decimals.
