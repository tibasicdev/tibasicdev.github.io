This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular command. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new command, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the command content. 

If a section (such as Advanced Uses) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

Make the |picture parameter the page name followed by .png and it will find the screenshot file, which is uploaded on the command index page, or will be shortly.


See [[[inc:nspire-command-help|inc:nspire-command-help]]] for a description of the command sidebar template.

fPart(//value//) returns the fractional part of //value//. Also works on complex numbers, lists and matrices.

+ Advanced Uses

fPart(, along with [[[nspire:int(]]] or [[[nspire:iPart(]]], can be used for integer [[[compression]]].

------

Also, fPart( is an easy way to find A mod B (the positive remainder when A is divided by B). 

[[code]]
:B(A<0)+iPart(BfPart(A/B))
[[/code]]

If A is guaranteed to be positive, the following shorter code can be used, omitting B(A<0):

[[code]]
:iPart(BfPart(A/B))
[[/code]]

------

Finally, the easiest way to check if a number is a whole number is not(fPart(X:

[[code]]
:If not(fPart(X:Then
: // X is an integer
:Else
: // X is not an integer
:End
[[/code]]

You can use this, for example, to check if a number is divisible by another: if X is divisible by N, then X/N is a whole number. This is useful when you want to find the [[[factorization|factors]]] of a number. Warning: when storing values with repeating decimals and later multiplying them to see if a number makes it an integer it can return a value of 1 or -1 instead of 0 even if it is an integer. Example: if you store 1/3 as X and then do fpart(3x) it will return 1 instead of 0. This is because fpart(.999...) results in .999... and then rounds to 1 when displaying rather than rounding to 1.0 and then displaying the fpart( as 0. 

+ Optimization

Often you want to find the value of a-1 mod b -- this occurs, for example, in movement routines with wraparound. However, the problem is that if a=0, a-1 will be negative. Rather than use the longer version of the modulo routine, you might replace subtracting 1 with adding (b-1). This will have the same result, but without sign problems.
