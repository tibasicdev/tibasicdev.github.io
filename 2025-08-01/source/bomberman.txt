This is a graphical rendition of the classic Bomberman genre! The objective of the game is to progress through as many levels as you can, blowing up enemies/bricks and making it safely to the exit. Features include multiple level setups, difficulty settings, randomly generated levels, in-game instructions, and excellent animated graphics.
