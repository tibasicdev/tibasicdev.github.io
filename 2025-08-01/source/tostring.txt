The {{toString(}} command, given any value including real numbers, complex numbers, lists, or matrices, returns the string representation of the value of the input.

[[code]]toString(1337       //returns "1337"

toString({1,2,3}    //returns "{1,2,3}"

toString([[1,2][3,4]]   //returns "[[1,2][3,4]]"

toString(√-1     //returns imaginary number "i" 
[[/code]]


{{toString(}} has less limitations than the {{[[[eval(]]]}} command. It can handle lists, matrices, and complex numbers. Another difference from {{eval(}} is that {{toString(}} is affected by display mode changes like {{[[[Fix]]]}}.

{{toString(}} replaces the old [[[number-to-string]]] routine previously used prior to OS 5.2.
