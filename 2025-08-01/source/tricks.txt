Tricks on the calculator. We've all been guilty of thinking, "Wow, it would be cool to screw up his calc." What? Only me?

Anyways, the only thing stopping you is knowledge. More specifically, the knowledge of how to do it.

The most basic trick is an infinite loop. Create a new program, call it whatever you want, and use the following code (Substitute the program's name for A):

[[code]]
:prgmA
[[/code]]

But this is boring. Let's screw up their math.

[[code]]
:Input "",A
:Disp ArandInt(2,5
:prgmA
[[/code]]

Note that both of these programs can be broken by pressing ON.
