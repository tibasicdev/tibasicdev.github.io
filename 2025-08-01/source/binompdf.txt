This command is used to calculate the binomial probability. In plainer language, it solves a specific type of often-encountered probability problem, that occurs under the following conditions:
# A specific event has only two outcomes, which we will call "success" and "failure"
# This event is going to repeat a specific number of times, or "trials"
# Success or failure is determined randomly with the same probability of success each time the event occurs
# We're interested in the probability that there are exactly N successes

For example, consider a couple that intends to have 4 children. What is the probability that 3 of them are girls?

# The event here is a child being born. It has two outcomes "boy" or "girl". We can call either one a success, but we'll choose to be sexist towards guys and call a girl a success in this problem
# The event is going to repeat 4 times, so we have 4 trials
# The probability of a girl being born is 50% or 1/2 each time
# We're interested in the probability that there are exactly 3 successes (3 girls)

The syntax here is {{binompdf(}}//trials//, //probability//, //value//). In this case:
[[code]]
:binompdf(4,.5,3
[[/code]]
This will give .25 when you run it, so there's a .25 (1/4) probability out of 4 children, 3 will be girls.

An alternate syntax for {{binompdf(}} leaves off the last argument, //value//. This tells the calculator to compute a list of the results for all values. For example:
[[code]]
:binompdf(4,.5
[[/code]]

This will come to {.0625 .25 .375 .25 .0625} when you run it. These are the probabilities of all 5 outcomes (0 through 4 girls) for 4 children with an equal probability of being born. There's a .0625 probability of no girls, a .25 probability of 1 girl, etc.

+ Advanced (for programmers)

The {{binompdf(}} and {{[[[binomcdf(]]]}} commands are the only ones apart from {{[[[seq-list|seq(]]]}} that can return a list of a given length, and they do it much more quickly. It therefore makes sense, in some situations, to use these commands as substitutes for {{seq(}}. 

Here's how to do it:

# {{cumSum(}}{{binomcdf(}}N,0 gives the list {1 2 ... N+1}, and {{cumSum(}}{{not(}}{{binompdf(}}N,0 gives the list {0 1 2 ... N}.
# With {{seq(}}, you normally do math inside the list: for example, {{seq(}}3I^^2^^,I,0,5
# With these commands, you do the same math outside the list: 3{{Ans}}^^2^^ where {{Ans}} is the list {0 1 ... 5}.

An example:
[[code]]
:seq(2^I,I,1,5
can be
:cumSum(binomcdf(4,0
:2^Ans
which in turn can be
:2^cumSum(binomcdf(4,0
[[/code]]

In general (where f() is some operation or even several operations):

[[code]]
:seq(f(I),I,1,N
can be
:cumSum(binomcdf(N-1,0
:f(Ans
which can sometimes be
:f(cumSum(binomcdf(N-1,0
[[/code]]

If the lower bound on I in the {{seq(}} statement is 0 and not 1, you can use {{binompdf(}} instead:

[[code]]
:seq(f(I),I,0,N
can be
:cumSum(not(binompdf(N,0
:f(Ans
which can sometimes be
:f(cumSum(not(binompdf(N,0
[[/code]]

This will not work if some command inside {{seq(}} can take only a number and not a list as an argument. For example, seq(L,,1,,(I),I,1,5 cannot be optimized this way.

+ Formulas

The value of {{binompdf(}} is given by the formula

[[math]]
\operatorname{binompdf}(n,p,k) = \binom{n}{k}\,p^k\,(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}\,p^k\,(1-p)^{n-k}
[[/math]]

This formula is fairly intuitive. We want to know the probability that out of n trials, exactly k will be successes, so we take the probability of k successes - [[$ p^k $]] - multiplied by the probability of (n-k) failures - [[$ (1-p)^{n-k} $]] - multiplied by the number of ways to choose which k trials will be successes - [[$ \binom{n}{k} $]].

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if the number of trials is at least 1 000 000 (unless the other arguments make the problem trivial).
* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if you try to generate a list of probabilities with at least 999 trials.
