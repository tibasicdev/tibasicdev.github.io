When contributing a tip or trick, please follow these guidelines:

# A tip/trick about using a command should only be included if it is undocumented or not well-known.
# A tip/trick should have some practical application as part of a program, and not just be something trivial.
# A tip/trick about making a program more efficient generally belongs on the [[[optimize|optimization]]] page.
# A tip/trick should be thoroughly explained and tested to make sure others can use it correctly.

**Eliminate Annoying Things**

If you want you to get rid of the “Done” message after you exit your program you can place some text or just a single double-quote on the last line of your program. Another option is to use the [[[Output(]]] command, which has the benefit of not moving the cursor to the second line.

[[code]]
:ClrHome
:Output(4,4,"Some Text
:"
[[/code]]

Another annoying thing is the run indicator that appears in the upper right corner of the screen. You can get rid of the run indicator by using Text(-1,0,90," " or Output(1,16," " (on the home screen) in a [[[getKey]]] loop:

[[code]]
:Repeat Ans
:Text(-1,0,90," // 1 space
:getKey→K
:End
[[/code]]

**Home Screen Text on Graph Screen**

To get home screen font on the graph screen (except on the regular TI-83) you should place '-1' at the beginning of the [[[Text(]]] command:

[[code]]
:Text(-1,Y,X,"Text
[[/code]]

**Digits in a Number**

To find out the number of digits in a whole number (i.e., a number without decimals), use the [[[log(]]] function. An [[[abs)]]] function prevents a domain error when taking the logarithm of a negative number:

[[code]]
:1+int(log(abs(#
[[/code]]

**Empty Variables**

You can create an empty string with "→Str1, and an empty list with the [[[ClrList]]] command.

**Displaying Quotes and Store**

Without storing them to a special string, you cannot usually display quotation marks (") and the [[[store]]] command (→). However, you can mimic these respectively in the [[[Text(]]] command by using two apostrophes (' '), and two subtract signs and a greater than sign (—>).

**Right Triangle Hypotenuse**

You can get the hypotenuse of a right triangle by using [[[R►Pr(]]]a,b), where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, or [[[abs(]]]a+b//i//, where a and b are the legs of a right triangle and //i// is the imaginary i.

**Dividing by 100**

Using the program editor, you can place the [[[percent|%]]] symbol directly into the code as a replacement for dividing by 100. This saves a few bytes each time you use it.

Using the [[[sub(]]] command, if only one argument is given and it contains an expression that evaluates to a real, complex, or list of numbers, the argument will be divided by 100.

[[code]]
:sub(225
    2.25
[[/code]]

**Turn the Screen Black**

If your window is set up so that Xscl < ΔX and Yscl < ΔY, you can use [[[GridOn]]] to make the entire screen black. You should note, however, that is rather slow.
You can also use [[[Shade(]]] to go faster.

[[code]]:Shade(Ymin,Ymax[[/code]]

**Inputting Coordinates**

Most programmers know the normal syntax for Input, but it can be used alone without any arguments. This simply displays a little "+" on the graph screen, along with the coordinates on the bottom. The plus symbol can be moved horizontally or vertically to a certain coordinate, and the command ends by pressing ENTER. The coordinates are then stored to x and y, respectively.

[[code]]:Input 
[[/code]]
**Faster Circles**

On the TI-83+ and above, the [[[Circle(]]] command has an alternate syntax. When a complex list such as {i} is added as the 4th argument, "fast circle" mode will be turned on, which uses the symmetries of a circle to save on trig calculations, and draws a circle in only 30% of the time it would normally take.

[[code]]
:Circle(0,0,5,{i
[[/code]]

**Extra Characters**

Although the extra characters are only available through an [[[assembly]]] program, once you have them you can store them to a string and then use the string in a program with no problems. The characters include lowercase letters and ASCII characters (such as @, &, #, $, and international characters like ä).

**Strange Control Flow**

There are a few cases of strange [[[controlflow|control flow]]], where you can use [[[If]]] conditionals by themselves, or together with [[[while|loops]]] and/or [[[DelVar]]], to create some interesting results. The Disp commands tell the input conditions under which they will be executed. 

* The dangling else (i.e, the executed statement itself is a conditional)

[[code]]
:If A:If B:Disp "B or not(A)
[[/code]]

[[code]]
:If A:Then
:Disp "A
:If B:Else
:Disp "not(A) or not(B)
:End
[[/code]]

* Misusing the [[[DelVar]]] bug that occurs when chaining an [[[If]]], [[[Else]]], or [[[End]]] command to the end

[[code]]
:If A:DelVar XIf 0
:Disp "not(A)
[[/code]]

[[code]]
:If A:Then
:Disp "A
:If B:DelVar XElse
:Disp "A and not(B)
:End
[[/code]]

**Running Programs from Assembly Shells**

As a matter of convenience, you can run your TI-Basic program from an [[[asmshells|assembly shell]]]. DoorsCS 6 will automatically display all programs, but you need to place a colon (":") as the first line of your program for MirageOS to recognize it. However, it should be noted that there is no guarantee that your program will work correctly when run by a shell.

**Moving Setup to Program End**

If you have a large program where speed is at a premium, then you want the main program loop as close to the beginning of the program as possible. Since [[[setup|program setup]]] is usually the code that is at the beginning of the program, this means that you should move it to the end of the program and then jump to it using a [[[Goto]]].

[[code]]
:99→I
:Goto 0
…
:Lbl 0
:ClrDraw
:ZStandard
:ZInteger
:Menu(" FROGGER v1.0 ","PLAY",1,"HELP",2,"EXIT",3
[[/code]]

**Self-Modifying Lists**

Formulas that return a single real number can stored and used in many ways when stored to a graphing variable such as u:

[[code]]
"5X+1->Y1
Disp Y1(2             ;11
"X^2+2X+1->u
Disp solve(u,X,0      ;1
[[/code]]

However, for formulas that return a list of numbers, lists can be used in the same way:

[[code]]
randIntNoRep(1,10->L1
Disp L1               ;{4,2,5,8,10,1,3,7,9,6
Disp L1               ;{9,2,6,3,10,7,1,8,4,5
[[/code]]
