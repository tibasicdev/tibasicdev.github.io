summary: 'A really big and cool virtual fishtank program.'
description: 'This is an extensive virtual fish program where you try to see how long you can keep a fish alive by feeding it, cleaning it''s tank, and giving it medicine. But that''s only the beginning! You can also catch more fish, sell them, play minigames, and experience all the surprises the game has in store for you! Details (about installation/setup and gameplay) are all in the readme. I hope you enjoy! Source Code included.'
