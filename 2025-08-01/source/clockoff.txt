The {{ClockOff}} command turns off the clock display at the bottom of the [[[settings|mode screen]]] on the TI-84+/SE calculators. You can turn the clock back on by using the {{[[[ClockOn]]]}} command, or by selecting 'TURN CLOCK ON' ,displayed in place of the clock on the mode screen.

The {{ClockOff}} command does not actually turn the clock off. The time can still be accessed through use of the {{[http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/gettime getTime]}} and {{[http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/getdate getDate]}} commands, and all their cousins.
