]]

The {{AndPic}} command logically takes the picture variable specified, and takes the current graph, and it finds the points at which both the graph and the picture have pixels, and it displays them only. If specified, //[row,column]// tells where the top left corner of the picture is to be placed. If not specified, the default is (0,0), which is the top left corner of the screen.
