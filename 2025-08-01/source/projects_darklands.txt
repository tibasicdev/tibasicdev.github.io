Hi this is my first time doing a project, I'm trying to program a game called "darklands" but there's still a lot I don't know about programming and I could use allot of help, any one who contributes in helping will get a spot in the credits. Just for some info on the main idea is that it's a futuristic rpg on you waking up out of a capsule, just to learn you were chosen by prophets 200 years ago to battle the dark forces of _________ * I still haven't got a name for him*, so that's all I have to say for now, I'm only available to post on; Thursday, Friday evening, and saturday. If you have questions feel free to ask.
