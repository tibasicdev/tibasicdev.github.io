The {{log(}} command computes the base 10 logarithm of a value -- the exponent to which 10 must be raised, to get that value. This makes it the inverse of the {{[[[ten-exponent|10^(]]]}} command.

{{log(}} is a real number for all positive real values. For negative numbers, {{log(}} is an imaginary number (so taking log( of a negative number will cause [[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]] to be thrown in {{[[[real-mode|Real]]]}} mode), and of course it's a complex number for complex values. log( is not defined at 0, even if you're in a complex mode.

+ Advanced Uses

Using either the {{[[[ln(]]]}} or the {{log(}} command, logarithms of any base can be calculated, using the identity:
[[math]]
\log_b{x} = \frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{b}} = \frac{\log{x}}{\log{b}} 
[[/math]]

So, to take the base B log of a number X, you could use either of the following equivalent ways:
[[code]]
:log(X)/log(B)
[[/code]]
[[code]]
:ln(X)/ln(B)
[[/code]]

This is the exponent to which B must be raised, to get X. If using OS 2.53 MP or higher, this formula can be circumvented entirely with an optional second argument:
[[code]]
:log(X,B)
[[/code]]

This form is functionally identical to the {{[[[logBASE]]]}} command with the same arguments available with the same OS, but unlike its counterpart does not have any special visual rendering when in {{MATHPRINT}} mode. Both {{logBASE}} and the second argument of {{log(}} are disabled in exam mode.

The base 10 logarithm specifically can also be used to calculate the number of digits a whole number has:

[[code]]
:1+int(log(N))
[[/code]]

This will return the number of digits {{N}} has, if {{N}} is a whole number. If {{N}} is a decimal, it will ignore the decimal digits of {{N}}.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#argument|ERR:ARGUMENT]]]** when attempting to use the second argument of {{log(}} in exam mode.
* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** when calculating {{log(0)}}.
* **[[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]]** if taking {{log(}} of a negative number in {{[[[real-mode|Real]]]}} mode.
