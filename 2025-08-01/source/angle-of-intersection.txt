The routine works by assuming the graphs are almost straight lines at a very small scale around the point of intersection given by X. The two graphs are approximated by complex numbers made by combining the x and y coordinates. The [[[angle(]]] command finds the angle for each complex number, then they are subtracted. This command is useful as it avoids domain errors caused by using [[[arctan| tanֿ¹(]]].

If you do not already know the x-coordinate of the intersection of the two graphs, you can add this line at the beginning to find it:
