The FnOff Command turns Graph functions off. The FnOff Command command can be used to clear the graph of any functions that the user has created before running any programs that might require the graph screen. The FnOff command can also be used to turn just one or a few functions off by stating the function number after the command FnOff:

[[code]]
:FnOn
:FnOff 2,3,4
[[/code]]

The above code will turn on all functions, and then it will turn off only functions 2, 3, and 4. You can use this if you only want one or two functions to display, but you want all the functions entered so that they can be quickly graphed.
