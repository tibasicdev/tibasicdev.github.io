The {{angle()}} command returns the angle of a complex number. The argument may be an expression, a list, or a matrix. In the case of a lists and matrices, each element is evaluated individually and the result is outputted to the corresponding element of a matrix or list of the same dimensions as the original.

[[code]]
:angle(2i)
      pi/2
:angle({2i,3+i})
      {pi/2  tan^-1(1/3)}
:angle([[2i,3+i][i+7,2i]])
      [pi/2  tan^-1(1/3)]
      [tan^-1(1/7)  pi/2]
