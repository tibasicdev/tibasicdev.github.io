The ≠ operator compares two values, returning true if they're different, and false if they're equal. It is a basic building block of the conditions used by commands such as [[[68k:If]]], [[[68k:when()]]], and [[[68k:While]]]. The results of ≠ and the other relational operators ([[[68k:equal|=]]], [[[68k:greater-than|>]]], [[[68k:greater-than-or-equal|≥]]], [[[68k:less-than|<]]], and [[[68k:less-than-or-equal|≤]]]) can be combined with the [[[68k:and]]], [[[68k:or]]], [[[68k:xor]]], and [[[68k:not]]] operators to create more complicated conditions.

It returns a single value for most types of data, and returns true if the two sides are mismatched in type: comparing a single number to a list, for instance, or comparing two lists that are of a different size. The only exception is when comparing two [[[68k:lists]]] or two [[[68k:matrices]]] of the same size: in that case, it compares them element-by-element, and returns a list or matrix of true/false values.

If either side or both contains undefined variables, ≠ will wait to return a value unless it's something clearly true or false for any value of the variable (for instance, x≠x). You can do math with the resulting inequality: if an operation makes sense, it will be applied to both sides: for instance, if x≠y, then you can negate it to get -x≠-y. An operation will not be applied to both sides if it wouldn't be consistent with the previous inequality: for example, you can't square both sides, since if x≠y it can still be the case that x^2=y^2. You can also extract the two halves of the inequality with [[[68k:left()]]] and [[[68k:right()]]].
