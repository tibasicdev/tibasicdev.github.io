The PolarGC ("Polar Grid Coordinates") command (like its opposite, the [[[RectGC]]]) command, affects how the coordinates of a point on the graph screen are displayed. When PolarGC is enabled, the coordinates of a point are displayed as (R,θ).

The polar coordinates of a point can be interpreted as the distance R it is away from the origin (0,0), and the direction θ. θ is the angle that a ray to the point would make with the positive X-axis (so polar coordinates are affected by [[[degree-mode|Degree]]]/[[[radian-mode|Radian]]] mode). An angle of 0 means the point is to the left of the origin; an angle of 90° (π/2 radians) means it's up from the origin, and so on. So, for example, the point with R=2 and θ=270° (3π/2 radians) would be two units down from the origin.

Of course, coordinates are only displayed with the [[[CoordOn]]] setting; however, with [[[CoordOff]]], RectGC and PolarGC are still useful, because in a variety of cases, the coordinates of a point are also stored to variables. PolarGC doesn't change the fact that they're stored to X and Y, as with RectGC; however, with PolarGC, they are also stored to R and θ.

Although the PolarGC command naturally goes with [[[polar-mode|Polar]]] graphing mode, the two settings are independent; you can use both PolarGC and RectGC with any graphing mode.

+ Advanced

The following situations involve storing coordinates of a point to variables:
* Graphing an equation
* Tracing an equation or plot
* Moving the cursor on the graph screen
* Using the interactive mode of one of the 2nd DRAW commands
* Using one of [[[DrawF]]], [[[DrawInv]]], or [[[Tangent(]]]
* Anything in the 2nd CALC menu.

Naturally, any command like [[[Input]]] or [[[Select(]]] which involves the above, will also store coordinates of a point.
