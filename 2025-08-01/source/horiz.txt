{{Horiz}} is usually at the beginning of a program. It is used at the beginning to ensure that the screen mode is {{Horiz}}, for programs such as Hangman that want to use {{[[[Input]]]}} but also have the graph screen shown. Note that if you use pixels, the y-coordinate can be no larger than 30, since that is the maximum pixel's range.
