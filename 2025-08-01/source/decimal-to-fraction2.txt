It starts by setting up a fraction with the input as the numerator and 1 as the denominator. After that, it multiplies both by 10 until the numerator is an integer, and then simplifies the fraction.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if Ans is an imaginary or complex number
* **[[[errors#reserved|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if Ans has more than 11 digits after the decimal.
