The {{Prompt}} command is the simplest way of getting [[[userinput|user input]]] on the [[[homescreen|home screen]]] (getting user input on the [[[graphscreen|graph screen]]] is only possible with the {{[[[getKey]]]}} command). Prompt displays [[[variables]]] one per line, with an equal sign and question mark (=?) displayed to the right of each variable. After the user enters a value or expression for the variables and presses ENTER, the values will be stored to the variables and program execution will resume.

{{Prompt}} can be used with every variable, but some of the variables have to be entered in a certain way. If the variable is a string or equation, the user must put quotes ("") around the value; the user must also put curly braces ({}) around lists and square brackets ([]) around matrices. Of course, ending quotes, braces, and brackets can be left off as usual.

When you use {{Prompt}} to input a named list, the {{∟}} in front of the name is dropped (so {{Prompt ∟NAME}} will display NAME=?). This can be confusing with single-letter names: {{Prompt ∟X}} and {{Prompt X}} both display X=?. Further enhancing the confusion, if the user enters a list for {{Prompt X}}, the list will be stored to ∟X instead.

During the Prompt, the user can press [2nd][MODE] to quit the program immediately.

+ Advanced Uses

Because simply displaying what variable the value will be stored to does not really tell the user what the variable will be used for, you can put a {{[[[Disp]]]}} command before {{Prompt}} to give the user some more insight into what an appropriate value for the variable would be. The {{Prompt}} command will be displayed one line lower, though, because the {{Disp}} command automatically creates a new line after itself. (Of course, you could also just use the {{[[[Input]]]}} command.)

[[code]]
:Disp "Enter the Score
:Prompt A
[[/code]]

+ Optimizations

When you have a list of {{Prompt}} commands (and each one has its own variable), you can just use the first {{Prompt}} command and combine the rest of the other {{Prompt}} commands with it. You remove the {{Prompt}} commands and combine the arguments, separating each argument with a comma. The arguments can be composed of whatever combination of variables is desired.

The advantages of combining {{Prompt}} commands are that it makes scrolling through code faster, and it is more compact (i.e. smaller) and easier to write than using the individual {{Prompt}} commands. The primary disadvantage is that it is easier to accidentally erase a {{Prompt}} command with multiple arguments.
