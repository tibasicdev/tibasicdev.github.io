The + operator adds two numbers, variables, or expressions together. Order of operations dictates that it's calculated after [[[68k:multiply|*]]] and [[[68k:divide|/]]], and at the same time as [[[68k:subtract|-]]].

The + operator can also be used on lists and matrices. For the most part, it behaves in the intuitive way, distributing the operation over each element. However, adding a number to a matrix (in either order) behaves differently: the number is only added along the main diagonal of the matrix. For "normal" addition that applies to every element of the matrix, see [[[68k:dotadd|.+]]].
