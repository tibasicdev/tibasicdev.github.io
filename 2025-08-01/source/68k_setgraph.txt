The setGraph() command is an analog of the [[[68k:setMode()]]] command, except that it's used specifically to change graph settings. setGraph(//setting//,//value//) will change //setting// to //value//, and return the old value of //setting//. Both settings and values are identified by strings (not case-sensitive, but very spelling-sensitive), which are listed on the [[[68k:mode-settings|]]] page.

[[code]]
:setGraph("Coordinates","OFF")
           "RECT"
:setGraph("Axes","OFF")
           "ON"
[[/code]]

Unlike setMode(), you can't change more than one setting at a time; there isn't a getGraph() function either, although you could use setGraph() to determine the mode setting if you really needed to.

+ Advanced Uses

As an alternative to the long and hard-to-remember strings, you can also identify the settings and values of setGraph() with short and still hard-to-remember numbers (or rather, string versions of numbers). The equivalents are also listed on the [[[68k:mode-settings|]]] page. For instance, "Coordinates" can be replaced with "1", and "IMPLICIT PLOT" with "5". If you use these codes as arguments to setGraph(), it will return such a code as well.

There are two advantages to this. First of all, writing the numbers is shorter, so it saves some space in the program. Second, it ensures that if, say, a French speaker is using your program with the language set to French, it will still work (normally, strings like "Coordinates" depend on the language setting).

------

Use the output of setGraph() to restore settings to what they were previously:
[[code]]
:setGraph("Axes","OFF")→oldaxes
...
:setGraph("Axes",oldaxes)
[[/code]]
