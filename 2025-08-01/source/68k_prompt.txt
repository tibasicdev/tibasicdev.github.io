The Prompt command functions much like the [[[68k:Input]]] command. It allows you to type a value to be stored to a variable. You can also prompt multiple values at the same time. For example:
[[code]]
Prompt A
//This will ask the user to type a value for A

Prompt A,B,C
//This will ask for a value for variables A,B, and C
[[/code]]
You can also ask for input in user-made variables
[[code]]
Prompt cool
//This asks for a value for the variable "cool"
[[/code]]
