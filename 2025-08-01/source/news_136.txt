|description=[[user GoVegan]] uploaded the first [/portable Portable Guide] in [http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/local--files/portable/TI%7CBD_portable_guide.pdf PDF form] (4.05mb). It is not a spectacular refined and polished version, and has many flaws. But at least we can see how the site renders when expanded to 150% on A4 sized paper. We will need to make some changes to some pages for better printability. Hooray! A milestone has been reached!
