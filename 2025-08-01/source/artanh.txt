The tanhֿ¹( command calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent of a value. tanhֿ¹(x) is the number y such that x = tanh(y).

tanhֿ¹(x), although it can be defined for all real and complex numbers, is real-valued only for x in the open interval (-1,1). Since Z80 calculators have their hyperbolic functions and inverses restricted to real values, [[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]] is thrown when x is outside the interval (-1,1).

The tanhֿ¹( command also works for lists.
