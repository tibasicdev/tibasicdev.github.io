The ³ command raises an input to the third power. It has exactly the same function as "^3", but is one byte smaller. If used on a list, it will return a list with all of the elements cubed. If used on a matrix, it will return the third matrix power of the input matrix.

+ Advanced Uses

One trick with ³ is to use it to save space (at the cost of speed) when using hard-coded values.  For instance, use 5³ instead of 125 to save one byte.

+ Optimization

Use this command instead of ^3 in all instances.
