summary: 'File Manager is a Celtic 3 program that allows you to run and manage files. You can manage BASIC programs, Application variables, and groups. Please read more for more information.'
description: "File Manager is special program for managing programs. In this program, you can archive, hide, lock, and run programs like a lot of other utilities. But this utility specifically is special in some ways. Manager can download the contents of programs or app variables, view the files inside any group file, prevent unlocking protected z80 assembly programs, parse for different program types (Any program, MirageOS, z80 assembly, and Ion), and converting programs to app variables and back to programs. THIS IS AN UPDATED VERSION 4.87.5, so feel free to explore the new updates implemented in the program. To view what updates that were specifically installed, click the Files To Send/Ver 4.88.2/New Updates.txt. This program is still compatible with the TI-83+/SE, but NOT recommended with the original TI-83. Please leave me a review and rate my file to help improve this program in the future! This program works on older operating systems, but has a catch. On the 84+/SE, the OS MUST be upgraded from 2.20 or later, 0.46 WILL NOT work. On the 83+/SE, the OS MUST be upgraded from 1.13 or later, 1.10 WILL NOT work. New Gifs have been made.\n\n[[code]]\n _    _           _       _            \n| |  | |         | |     | |           \n| |  | |_ __   __| | __ _| |_ ___  ___ \n| |  | | '_ \\ / _` |/ _` | __/ _ \\/ __|\n| |__| | |_) | (_| | (_| | ||  __/\\__ \\\n \\____/| .__/ \\__,_|\\__,_|\\__\\___||___/\n       | |                             \n       |_|       (Updates)\n\nNew updates for File Manager:\n\n    Info\n\nVersion: 4.88.2\nSize: 6783 (301 bytes less from previous)\nLines of code: 632 (50 lines less from previous)\nCapability: TI-83+/84+/SE\nTotal Updates: Probably 5\n\n    Implemented/Removed Functions\n        A - Added\n        R - Removed\n        C - Changed\n\n* Changed the Loading programs screen.\n* Changed program to selection single program display instead of a list...\n\nBefore:\n\n[PROG 1]\n PROG 2\n PROG 3\n PROG 4\n\nNow:\n[    PROG 1    ]\n\n* Reverted download method back to line-by-line.\n* Changed \"Download\" option names to \"Copy\".\n\nWhen programs are downloaded, the code is stored into a program called\n\"DOWNLOAD\".
