The {{Connected}} command sets all equations to use the usual graph style - a connected line. In addition, this graph style is made the default, so that when a variable is deleted it will revert to this graph style. The other possible setting for this option is {{[[[Dot]]]}}.

Compare this to the {{[[[GraphStyle(]]]}} command, which puts a single equation into a specified graph style.

The {{Connected}} and {{Dot}} commands don't depend on [[[graphing mode]]], and will always affect all functions, even in other graphing modes. The exception to this is that {{[[[seq-mode|sequence]]]}} mode's default is always the dotted-line style, even when {{Connected}} mode is set. The {{Connected}} command will still change their graphing style, it just won't change the default they revert to.

In addition to graphing equations, this setting also affects the output of {{[[[DrawF]]]}}, {{[[[DrawInv]]]}}, and {{[[[Tangent(]]]}}.
