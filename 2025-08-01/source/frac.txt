{{►Frac}} attempts to display the input in fraction form.  It only works on the [[[homescreen|home screen]]] outside a program, or with the {{[[[Disp]]]}} and {{[[[Pause]]]}} commands in a program. It takes up to 12 decimal places of a non-terminating decimal to find the corresponding fraction. The decimal input is returned if {{►Frac}} fails to find the fraction form.

For a more versatile algorithm for finding fractions, see the [[[Decimal to Fraction]]] routine.
