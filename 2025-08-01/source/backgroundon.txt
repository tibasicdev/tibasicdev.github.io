With the introduction of color and a higher resolution screen than the monochrome calculators, the TI-84+CSE and TI-84+CE included the ability to display a background image on the graphscreen. The images variables are similar to the picture variables in that there 10 slots. In addition, functions can be drawn on top of images. 

{{BackgroundOn}} recalls an image variable or color and displays it on the graphscreen. 

[[code]]
:BackgroundOn Image1
is the same as
:BackgroundOn 1
[[/code]]

Intrestingly, the following is a valid syntax, which fills the graphscreen with a light blue (18).

[[code]]
:15→B
:BackgroundOn B+3
[[/code]]

In addition, {{BackgroundOn}} can be used to fill the graphscreen with a solid color. The color variables range from 10 to 24, blue to dark gray, as documented [[[textcolor |here]]]. For example, {{BackgroundOn}} 12 will fill the graphscreen with black.

[[code]]
:BackgroundOn 12
[[/code]]
