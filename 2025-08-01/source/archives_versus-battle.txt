description: 'A simple battle game with single-calculator player-versus-player and player-versus-cpu modes. To install, simply ungroup it. G1P and G2P are the master programs, the other programs provide the nescessary function calls. There seems to be a bug in the ai routine (involving the block command), let me know if you manage to fix it.'
