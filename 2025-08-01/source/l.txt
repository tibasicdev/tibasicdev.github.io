The ∟ character is used at the start of the name of any custom list you create, for example:

[[code]]
{1,2,3}→∟HELLO
{4,5,6}→∟WORLD
[[/code]]

In most cases you need to include this when accessing or manipulating a custom list (although there's a few exceptions, see the //Optimization// section below). You do not need this character when accessing the the default lists {{L₁}}...{{L₆}}). 

The maximum length of the list name (not including the {{∟}}) is five letters. {{∟ABCDE}} works, but {{∟ABCDEF}} does not. List names must start with a letter A-Z but can also include numbers so {{∟LIST1}} and {{∟LIST2}} are valid list names, but {{∟123}} is not.

There are two ways to insert this character:

# Press {{2nd}}, {{LIST}}, press right arrow to access the {{OPS}} menu, scroll to the bottom, and press {{ENTER}} to insert the {{∟}} character. You can then type the rest of the name of your list.
# If your custom list already exists, you can press {{2nd}}, {{LIST}}, select the name of your list, and press {{ENTER}}. The whole name including the {{∟}} character will be inserted.


+ Optimization

You don't actually need to include the ∟ command when [[[store|storing]]] (→) to a list. 

[[code]]
{1,2,3}→HELLO
{4,5,6}→WORLD
{7,8,9}→X
[[/code]]

Although the name {{X}} as used above also matches the name of a regular real variable, since the data being stored is a list, it will be saved to {{∟X}}.

When storing to a specific //list item//, you MUST still include the {{∟}} character:

[[code]]
1→∟HELLO(1)
2→∟WORLD(2)
3→∟X(3)
[[/code]]

Some of the list commands also allow for leaving off the {{∟}} character, such as {{[[[SetUpEditor]]]}}. However, //be careful// when doing so with {{[[[Input]]]}} and {{[[[Prompt]]]}} because you might only be asking the user to input a list, but if a real value is entered, it would be saved to a real variable instead.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown if you try to reference/create a list with more than 5 characters in its name.
* **[[[errors#undefined|ERR:UNDEFINED]]]** is thrown if you try to use ∟ on an undefined list.
