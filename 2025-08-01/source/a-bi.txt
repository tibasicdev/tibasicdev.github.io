The {{a+b//i//}} command puts the calculator into rectangular complex number mode. This means that:
* Taking square roots of negative numbers, and similar operations, no longer returns an error.
* Complex results are displayed in the form {{a+b//i//}} (hence the name of the command)

This is the standard way of displaying complex numbers, though they can also be displayed in polar form (see {{[[[re-thetai|re^θi]]]}} for more details). To extract the coefficients a and b, use the {{[[[real-func|real(]]]}} and {{[[[imag(]]]}} commands.

+ Advanced Uses

Rather than switch to a+b//i// mode, you might want to force the calculations to use complex numbers by making the original argument complex. The general way to do this is by adding +0//i// to the number. However, there may be an optimization in any particular case. See the [[[quadratic formula]]] routine for a good example of this.
