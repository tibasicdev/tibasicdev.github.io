The ^ operator is used to raise a number (the base) to a power (the exponent) -- x^y is "pretty-printed" as x^^y^^. When the exponent is a positive integer, this is equivalent to multiplying the base by itself that many times.

When the base is a real number, the result will always be a real number if possible: for example (-1)^(1/3) will return -1. Some powers will return a complex number because there //is// no real number answer (or give an error, if the calculator is in real number mode). When the base is a complex number, the result will be the principal branch.

For lists, the ^ operator works componentwise -- x^{a,b,c,...} will return {x^a,x^b,x^c,...}, {x,y,z,...}^a will return {x^a,y^a,z^a,...}, and two lists of the same length will be matched up element by element.

Typing [2nd] [LN] or [♦] [LN] also pastes //e//^( -- this is not a separate command (unlike the TI-83 series), and just uses the ^ operator to do its work. It is, however, the simplest way to type the constant //e//.

A minor quirk of the ^ operator is that if it's present multiple times in one expression, it is evaluated right to left (unlike most commands, which are evaluated left to right). For example, x^y^z will be interpreted as x^(y^z) rather than (x^y)^z. The reason this is done is that (x^y)^z can easily be rewritten as x^(y*z), so there's no need for two powers. x^(y^z) can't be rewritten that way. Therefore, it's much more meaningful to interpret x^y^z as x^(y^z).

+ Advanced Uses

The ^ operator can be used as an alternative to an "xth root" operator, which the 68k calculators don't have. If you want to take the Nth root of a number, raise it to the 1/N-th power instead.

------

The ^ operator is also useful for square matrices. Raising a square matrix to an integer power between -32768 and 32767 just multiples the matrix by itself, taking the inverse first for negative matrices. A matrix to the 0th power is the identity.

For raising a matrix to a fractional power, or raising a number to a matrix power, a different definition is used: see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. This definition is in fact compatible with the repeated-multiplication method, except that it is far more general.

None of these situations are equivalent to applying ^ to every element of a matrix. For that, see the [[[68k:dotpower|.^]]] command.
