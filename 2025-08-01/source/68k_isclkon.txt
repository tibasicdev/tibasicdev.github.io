The isClkOn() command checks if the calculator's clock (which is used by most [[[68k:time and date]]] commands) is running or stopped. The result of isClkOn() is a truth value -- true if the clock is on, and false if the clock is off -- which makes it perfect for a condition in commands such as [[[68k:If]]]:
[[code]]
:If isClkOn() Then
: Disp "Clock is running."
:Else
: Disp "Clock is stopped."
:EndIf
[[/code]]

The isClkOn() command, though useful, isn't often called for. For instance, there's no need to check if the clock is on if you're planning to turn it on anyway:
[[code]]
:If not isClkOn()
: ClockOn

should just be

:ClockOn
[[/code]]
One use for [[[68k:isClkOn()]]] is in functions, which aren't allowed to change the global status of the calculator with commands like [[[68k:ClockOn]]] or [[[68k:ClockOff]]]. Instead, you might do the next best thing, and return an error message if the clock is turned off.
