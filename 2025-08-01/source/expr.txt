The {{expr(}} command is used to evaluate an expression that's stored in a string (an expression is merely anything that returns a value - of any type). Expressions are occasionally stored to strings, rather than evaluated outright, so that their value has the capacity to change when the variables stored inside them change.  The {{expr(}} command's result depends on the kind of expression that's in the string you pass it -- it may return a number, a list, a matrix, or even another string. 

As a special case of an expression, the {{expr(}} command can also be used to convert a string like {{"123"}} to the number {{123}}. Going in the reverse direction ({{123}} to {{"123"}}) is [[[number-to-string|more complicated]]].

The {{expr(}} command has limitations. Here are the situations in which {{expr(}} will not work:

* When the code in the string does not return an answer, and thus is not an expression: e.g. {{expr("Line(0,0,1,1"}} or {{expr("prgmHELLO"}} is invalid

* When the expression in the string contains an {{expr(}} command itself, e.g. {{expr("expr(Str1"}} -- this will throw an [[[errors#illegalnest|ERR:ILLEGAL NEST]]] error.

* In place of a variable (rather than an expression), e.g. {{5→expr("X"}} isn't a substitute for {{5→X}} because {{expr("X"}} evaluates to the value of {{X}} and not to {{X}} itself.

+ Advanced Usage with Lists

{{expr(}} is often used in conjunction with the {{[[[Input]]]}} command to prompt the user to enter a list. Although the {{Input}} command can already handle lists, it requires the user to enter the opening bracket that signifies a list. With {{expr(}}, this can be avoided.

If you want the user to enter a list separated by commas, instead of:
[[code]]
Input L₁
[[/code]]

Use this:
[[code]]
Input Str1
expr("{"+Str1→L₁
[[/code]]

This will automatically put the curly bracket in so the user does not have to.

Just be aware that you //cannot// access individual list items directly after the {{expr()}} function, unlike how you can with {{[[[Ans]]]}}. The following code will //multiply// the entire list by 2 rather than return the second item:

[[code]]
expr("{1,2}")(2)
[[/code]]

Instead, to access the second item in the list you could split this across two lines and use {{Ans}}:

[[code]]
expr("{1,2}")
Ans(2)
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

Evaluating an expression inside a string is more complicated than evaluating a normal expression; you should therefore try to take as much out of an {{expr(}} statement as possible to speed up your code. For example:
[[code]]
expr("sum({"+Str1
[[/code]]

can be:
[[code]]
sum(expr("{"+Str1
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#illegalnest|ERR:ILLEGAL NEST]]]** is thrown when the string to be evaluated contains an expr( itself.
* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** is thrown when trying to evaluate the empty string.
* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown when trying to evaluate a command that doesn't return a value.
