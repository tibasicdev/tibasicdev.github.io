The OS version 2.07 update introduced several commands for dealing with times and dates. Some of these rely on the built-in clock, while others are used for formatting. 

TI-84+ programmers will not find many differences in function here -- these commands were added to both calculator series at the same time, and are almost exactly the same. The only difference is the addition of the [[[68k:getTmZn()]]] and [[[68k:setTmZn()]]] commands, and the absence of a days-between-dates command.

++ Low-Level Commands

* **[[[68k:startTmr()]]]** -- This command returns the current value of a timer that is updated every second when the clock is enabled. This value doesn't correspond to any actual time, but can be used with [[[68k:checkTmr()]]] to get a time difference.
* **[[[68k:checkTmr()]]]** -- checkTmr(t) is equivalent to [[[68k:startTmr()]]]-t. This can be used to get the time elapsed since startTmr was used.
* **[[[68k:ClockOn]]]**, **[[[68k:ClockOff]]]** -- Enables or disables the hardware clock.
* **[[[68k:isClkOn()]]]** -- Tests if the clock is enabled or not.

++ Time Commands

* **[[[68k:setTime()]]]** -- Sets the current time, in hours, minutes, and seconds. If the clock is enabled, this time will be updated every second.
* **[[[68k:getTime()]]]** -- Returns the current time as the list {hours, minutes, seconds}. This command is unaffected by time format.
* **[[[68k:setTmFmt()]]]** -- Sets the time format - 12 hour, or 24 hour.
* **[[[68k:getTmFmt()]]]** -- Returns this time format setting.
* **[[[68k:getTmStr()]]]** -- Returns the current time as a string, affected by time format (though you can override it with an optional argument).
* **[[[68k:setTmZn()]]]** -- Sets the current time zone, as an offset (in minutes) from GMT.
* **[[[68k:getTmZn()]]]** -- Returns the current time zone.

++ Date Commands 

* **[[[68k:setDate()]]]** -- Sets the current date (year, month, and day). If the clock is enabled, this date will be updated as needed.
* **[[[68k:getDate()]]]** -- Returns the current date as the list {year, month, day}. This command is unaffected by date format.
* **[[[68k:setDtFmt()]]]** -- Sets the date format - 1 for month/day/year, 2 for day/month/year, or 3 for year/month/day.
* **[[[68k:getDtFmt()]]]** -- Returns this date format setting.
* **[[[68k:getDtStr()]]]** -- Returns the current date as a string, affected by date format (though you can override it with an optional argument).

++ Time/Date Manipulation

* **[[[68k:timeCnv()]]]** -- Converts a number of seconds into a list of {days, hours, minutes, seconds} representing the same time lapse.
* **[[[68k:dayOfWk()]]]** -- Returns the day of week (Sunday through Saturday encoded as 1 through 7) of a specified date.
