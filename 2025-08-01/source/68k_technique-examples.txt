The programs linked from this page are short programs meant to demonstrate the use of several programming techniques described elsewhere in this guide. For readers who learn better by example than by explanation, these programs are a great way to learn these techniques.

These programs have been fully [[[68k:optimization|optimized]]], except where this would interfere with readability. For example, the names of variables could easily be converted to single characters -- this was deliberately left undone. The individual pages explain what would be done to finish the job of optimization.
