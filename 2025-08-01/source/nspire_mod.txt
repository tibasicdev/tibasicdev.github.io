[!--
This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular command. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new command, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the command content. 

If a section (such as Advanced Uses) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

Make the |picture parameter the page name followed by .png and it will find the screenshot file, which is uploaded on the command index page, or will be shortly.


See [[[inc:nspire-command-help|inc:nspire-command-help]]] for a description of the command sidebar template.

[[include inc:nspire-command
|picture=sample.png
|summary=Returns the modulo of //value1// with respect to //value2//
|syntax=mod(//value1//, //value2//)

|location=@@Describe how to get the command from a menu.

|compatibility = @@If this is only available on certain versions of the nspire
|size=1 byte(s)
]]

This command returns the modulo of two numbers. This is defined as the remainder when //value1// is divided by //value2//. This command is identical to the [[[nspire:remain]]] command, which returns the remainder of the dividend. 

[[code]]
mod(12,5) = 2

mod(8,2) = 0

mod(64, 15) = 4

+ Error Conditions

Error conditions still need to be added to this command page
[!-- This section is still in progress
[[include inc:nspire-error num=260|error=Domain error|cause=the argument is not in the range 1-99]]
[[include inc:nspire-error num=780|error=No solution found|cause=the equation doesn't have a solution]]

Exclude the following errors because they don't rely on the specifics of a command, and can occur almost anywhere: 180-Break, 210-Data type, 670-Memory (but do include 673-Memory, because that's unusual), 680..720-Missing (..}, 790-Non-algebraic variable, 830-Overflow, and 910..940-Syntax-type errors.
