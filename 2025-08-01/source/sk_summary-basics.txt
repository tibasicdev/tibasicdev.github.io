# TI-Basic is the built-in programming language on all of TI's graphing calculators.
# When making programs, there is a general order that you follow: you create the program, then you edit the program, and finally you execute the program.
# A variable is a place where a data can be stored globally. Each of the letters A through Z (as well as the θ symbol, which is Greek and pronounced "theta") is a variable that can hold a number.
# Input happens when a program lets the person running it press a key or type something in, so that it can do something with that. Output happens when a program displays results on the screen.
# Control structures are instructions that explain which steps the calculator should follow, and in which order.
# The Goto command tells the calculator to jump to another point (more specifically, a corresponding Lbl) in the program, and continue running it from there.
# Loops are a type of control structure used to repeat a block of code several times. There are two kinds of loops: a loop that repeats until a condition is satisfied and a loop that repeats a fixed number of times.
