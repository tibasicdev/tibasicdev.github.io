This command is used to calculate Poisson distribution cumulative probability. In plainer language, it solves a specific type of often-encountered probability problem, that occurs under the following conditions:
# A specific event happens at a known average rate (X occurrences per time interval)
# Each occurrence is independent of the time since the last occurrence
# We're interested in the probability that the event occurs at most a specific number of times in a given time interval.

The {{poissoncdf(}} command takes two arguments: The //mean// is the average number of times the event will happen during the time interval we're interested in. The //value// is the number of times we're interested in the event happening (so the output is the probability that the event happens at most //value// times in the interval). Note that you may need to convert the mean so that the time intervals in both cases match up. This is done by a simple proportion: if the event happens 10 times per minute, it happens 20 times per two minutes.

For example, consider point on a city street where an average of 5 cars pass by each minute. What is the probability that in a given minute, no more than 3 cars will drive by?

# The event is a car passing by, which happens at an average rate of 5 occurences per time interval (a minute)
# Each occurrence is independent of the time since the last occurrence (we'll assume this is true, though traffic might imply a correlation here)
# We're interested in the probability that the event occurs at most 3 times in the time interval.

The syntax in this case is:
[[code]]
:poissoncdf(5,3
[[/code]]
This will give about .265 when you run it, so there's a .265 probability that in a given minute, no more than 3 cars will drive by.

+ Formulas

The {{poissoncdf(}} command can be seen as a sum of {{[[[poissonpdf(]]]}} commands:

[[math]]
\operatorname{poissoncdf}(\lambda,k)=\sum_{i=0}^k \operatorname{poissonpdf}(\lambda,i) = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac {e^{-\lambda} \lambda^i}{i!}
[[/math]]

We can also write the {{poissoncdf(}} command in terms of the [wikipedia:Incomplete_gamma_function incomplete gamma function]:

[[math]]
\operatorname{poissoncdf}(\lambda,k)=\frac{\Gamma(k+1,\lambda)}{k!}
[[/math]]
