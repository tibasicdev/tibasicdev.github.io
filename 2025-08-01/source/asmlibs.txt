Assembly libraries are commonly used by TI-Basic programs to provide features that enhance them. Since TI-Basic programs don't have access to any of the internal functions of the calculator and the peripherals, assembly libraries can bridge that gap. The only caution about using assembly programs is that you need to make sure to include the assembly program if you give your program to someone else.

* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/369/36934.html Auto Power-Down]** -- This tool allows BASIC programmers to implement an APD feature into their main loop. An example is included. An 84+ is recommended (but not altogether necessary) to implement this into a BASIC program. Note: This program will work with OnBlock. Even if OnBlock is enabled, when using this program, the user will be able to turn the calculator back on and continue with the execution of the program.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/125/12500.html BASIC Tools]** -- BASIC Tools is a really neat set of assembly programs which can be used to allow BASIC programs to have really neat featues. BASIC Tools allows BASIC programs to inverse text, power off the calculator mid-program, change the contrast level, shift the screen up, determine the current contrast level, enable alphalock, determine the amount of free RAM, and check the batteries!
* **[http://www.unitedti.org/index.php?download=228 CELTIC]** -- This is an ASM utility to be used with BASIC programs that will empower BASIC programs to perform a variety of functions that BASIC would not previously allow, including the ability to read or write appvars and programs and swap variables between RAM and Archive.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/318/31824.html Codex]** -- This is an awesome asm utility for basic programmers. It includes 32 assembly functions that basic programmers can use. It is centered mostly upon graphical functions. Yet there are some other miscellaneous functions. I believe it is one of the most complete utilities for basic programmers.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/301/30193.html Custom pics]** -- This program allows you to save an unlimited number of pics with custom names. The pictures are stored in lists of 786 bytes. program size:182 bytes. my first ASM program. No shell needed.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/377/37721.html Flash Gordon]** -- It's the famous Flash Gordon, with two subroutines that I've written to make this great program less of a pain in a neck. Basically, what it does is that you run this, and you don't have archive/unarchive your programs: they all stay in the archive, which means faster loading and less wear and tear on the flash memory.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/166/16686.html Graph Screen Wipes]** -- This is a collection of 8 screenwipes. They will take whatever is in the graph buffer and move it up, left, down, right, up+left, up+right, down+left or down+right. Useful as a subroutine in either basic or assembly programs. Same principle behind side-scrolling games... except this shows how to do diagonal as well as left, right, up and down. 2nd release: Bugfree as far as I know. Also contains a demo program to demonstrate what it does. 3rd release: Now supports user defined scrolling amounts (store a number in X, and the screen will be scrolled that many lines).
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/155/15559.html GreyPic8x]** -- This program takes three pics (pic1, pic2 & pic3) and converts them into a greyscale screen. Very useful for Basic programmers if they want a greyscale title picture.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/159/15902.html Instant Graph Inverse]** -- This program takes the graph buffer and inverses it (very quickly). Very useful as a subroutine for either basic or assembly programs.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/385/38591.html InstCirc]** -- InstCirc is an ASM program designed to be callable from within TI-BASIC programs. It allows BASIC users to create circles much faster than the built in TI-OS routine. This is NOT another 4-part circle drawing flag enabler that so many other fast circ programs are.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/373/37343.html Inverter]** -- The impetus for this program came from all the *low quality* BASIC graphics programs I've seen posted at ticalc.org, most of which deal with inverting large portions of the screen. Well, in my humble opinion, that sort of thing is best handled in ASM instead. Thus, here is an exceedingly fast and small full screen inverter. It inverts the screen instantaneously and is only 36 bytes!
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/226/22626.html Omnicalc]** -- Omnicalc integrates additional functionality into your 83+'s operating system. For example, it adds more functions for BASIC programmers, base conversions, and compressed programs, among other things. This latest version provides bug fixes, including the ability to now transfer and group BASIC programs using Omnicalc functions.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/330/33039.html OnBlock]** -- A simple program that installs an interrupt that blocks the use of the On Break in basic programs.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/357/35781.html Picture Manager]** -- This program merges the capabilities of ZPIC, ZSTO and a few new functions into 1 program. Basically, you can archive/unarchive/delete/recall/store up to 255 different pictures on your calculator! It also returns various error codes in case something went wrong (like bad input), so the program wont error out! This is MOST useful in graphics-intensive programs, like BASIC picture editors and BASIC games.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/389/38915.html RAGE]** -- It accepts lists now instead of several vars. Also, the best improvement is the new support of user defined sprites. Games like Tetris, Duckhunt, Chess, Checkers, and Monopoly are now easily possible in Basic. Check it out if you'd like an alternative to xLib or Omnicalc, as this takes up less than 1K and is fully customizable.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/372/37261.html Resource]** -- This routine is very useful for everyone. You can save a lot of free RAM memory when using Resource. It copies programs (TI-Basic and Asm) to RAM from Archive; so they only need free RAM when they are running! The routine could be used within TI-Basic programs or stand-alone at home screen!
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/171/17119.html Screen Shot Maker]** -- This program lets you take a screen shot of the graph and saves it as an assembly program. The new program, when you run it, copies the picture to the graph and displays it. This is useful for Basic programmers that are writing graphics-heavy programs and have run out of pics. This version is bug-free. If you don't like the program much, it does have a nice string input routine you might like.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/228/22851.html Symbolic]** -- This application installs new functions onto your calculator. These can be used anywhere in the TI-83+ OS. These functions include a symbolic differentiation and simplification. Great for a lot of math classes.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/299/29955.html TLIB]** -- This library is written for BASIC programmers who want to use ASM's advantages without having do learn this difficult language ! With TLIB, you can : - Run the indicator OFF - Clear the screen with horizontal and vertical lines (it is not really faster than BASIC : 6sec instead of 8sec ) - Do a pause (with a countdown) - Switch off the calculator - Inverse all the pixels of the plot screen - write in video inverse mode - and cancel this "video inverse mode".
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/303/30341.html Variable Status]** -- This little package can identify if a variable/program/whatever exists and whether or not it is archived. It can also determine if a program is ASM or BASIC!
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/384/38439.html XKeys]** -- A library that allows BASIC to detect multiple key presses. I've also included a demo that shows how to detect the arrow keys. The readme explains in more detail and includes a key code chart. This was designed with games in mind so it is small, fast, and easy to use. This version does not use interrupts or any safe RAM areas, so it should be safe to use with other libraries.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/359/35907.html xLIB]** -- An APP that adds functionality to TI-83/4+ BASIC programs. It installs a parser hook which will intercept any [[[real-func|real(]]] requests. See the [[[xLIB]]] article for more information about it.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/391/39138.html Xtravar Beta 1]** -- Xtravar Beta 1 is a no-shell assembly program that lets you use up to 256 different strings, matrices, pics, etc. It also lets you use special characters. The best part is that you can send your program to other calcs and they won't need this program to run it!
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/142/14283.html ZBASIC Library]** -- ZBASIC is a set of 10 ASM routines which BASIC programs can access and use. These include inverting the screen, getting free RAM amount, setting/checking contrast level, getting battery status, shifting the screen up, etc.
* **[http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/296/29608.html ZBTools]** -- Assembly Tools for Basic Programmers. It provides several useful functions for TI-Basic programmers.
* **[http://www.tibasicdev.wikidot.com/celtic3 Celtic III]** -- Celtic III is a Flash Application for the TI-83 Plus, TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus, and the TI 84 Plus Silver Edition graphing calculators [ TI-83/84+(SE), designed to extend the functionality of these calculators so that BASIC games and utilities can perform actions that cannot easily be done through the language itself. Celtic III includes all commands from Xlib and some from OmniCalc.
