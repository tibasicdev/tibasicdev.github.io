tanֿ¹( returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseTangent.html arctangent] of its argument. It is the inverse of [[[tan(]]], which means that tanֿ¹(n) produces an angle θ such that tan(θ)=n.

Like tan(, the result of tanֿ¹( depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] mode. However, unlike tangent, the result is in degrees or radians, not the argument. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion of θ=tanֿ¹(n) from radians to degrees is θ*180/π and from degrees to radians is θ*π/180. The tanֿ¹( command also works on a list.

tanֿ¹( will always return a value between -π/2 and π/2 (or -90° and 90°).

In radians:

:tanֿ¹(1)

In degrees:

:tanֿ¹(1)

+ Optimization

Expressions of the form tanֿ¹(//y/////x//) are usually better recast as R►Pθ(//x//,//y//); the latter will not fail even if //x// should happen to be equal to zero.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you input a complex value or a matrix.
