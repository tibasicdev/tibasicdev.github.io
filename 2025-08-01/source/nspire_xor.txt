This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular command. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new command, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the command content. 

If a section (such as Advanced Uses) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

Make the |picture parameter the page name followed by .png and it will find the screenshot file, which is uploaded on the command index page, or will be shortly.

 **xor** takes two numbers of expressions and checks to see if //exactly one// is True.  If both are True or both are False, it returns 0.
[[code]]1 xor 0
           1

:2 xor (3 xor 0)    (after evaluating 3 xor 0, it simplifies into True xor True.)
           0

:0 xor (1-1)^2
           0[[/code]]
++ Table of Results
For reference, the following true/false table shows what gets returned when you use different combinations of 1 (true) and 0 (false):

||~ xor ||~ 1 (true) ||~ 0 (false) ||
||~ 1 (true) || 0 (false) || 1 (true) ||
||~ 0 (false) || 1 (true) || 0 (false) ||
