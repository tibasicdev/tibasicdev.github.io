The format() command is a more advanced version of [[[68k:string()]]] specifically intended to convert numbers (usually, floating-point numbers) to strings. It can override settings like Display Digits and Exponential Format, and instead lets the user input these options and more in a string. Since it converts even integer input to floating-point, it also doesn't depend on the Base setting.

The format string can have the following values (not case-sensitive):
* **F//[number]//** overrides Display Digits to fixed-point with //[number]// digits after the decimal; //[number]// can be omitted to use the default, which is 12; it must be between 0 and 12.
* **S//[number]//** does this and also overrides Exponential Format to scientific.
* **E//[number]//** does this and also overrides Exponential Format to engineering.
* **G//[number][character]//** does this and also separates the digits to the left of the decimal into groups of three, with //[character]// as the separator. The default for //[character]//, if it is omitted, is a comma. If you make the separator a period, then the decimal point will become a comma.

To all of these, you can also append **R//[character]//** to replace the decimal point with //[character]//. Only 'symbols' are allowed for //[character]//, which is a bit vague: numbers and letters are not allowed, nor are some international characters.

[[code]]
:format(π,"F")
           "3.14159265359"
:format(2^25,"S6")
           "3.355443e7"
:format(2^25,"E6")
           "33.55443e6"
:format(2^25,"G0")
           "33,554,432."
:format(2^25,"G0 R ")
           "33 554 432 "
[[/code]]

If the format string is empty, or if the argument is omitted entirely, format() will convert the number to a decimal, but otherwise will work just like [[[68k:string()]]]
