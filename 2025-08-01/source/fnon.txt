The {{FnOn}} command is used to turn on equations in the current [[[graphing mode]]]. When you define an equation, it's turned on by default, but the {{[[[FnOff]]]}} command can turn an equation off (in which case, it's still defined, but isn't graphed). To turn functions on and off manually, put your cursor over the = symbol in the equation editor, and press enter.

When {{FnOn}} is used by itself, it will turn on all defined equations in the current graphing mode. You can also specify which equations to turn on, by writing their numbers after {{FnOn}}: for example, {{FnOn 1}} will turn off the first equation, and {{FnOn 2,3,4,5}} will turn the second, third, fourth, and fifth. The numbers you give {{FnOn}} have to be valid equation numbers in the graphing mode. When turning equations on and off in [[[seq-mode|sequence]]] mode, use 1 for {{u}}, 2 for {{v}}, and 3 for {{w}}.

The most common use for {{FnOn}} and {{[[[FnOff]]]}} is to disable functions when running a program, so that they won't interfere with what you're doing on the graph screen, then enable them again when you're done.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if an equation number isn't valid in the current graphing mode, or at all.
