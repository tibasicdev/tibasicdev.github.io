[[/code]]

You can replace 465230.61649186 with any obscure and nearly impossible number.

If Ans is a list, it is stored to ∟A. A remains whatever that number is, and A=Ans(1 (assuming that Ans as a list has at least one value) returns false. If Ans is a number, it is stored into A, thus A=Ans(1 (Ans times 1) returns true.

The For( command is used to avoid updating Ans. End should be added to the end if this routine is used inside a larger program.
