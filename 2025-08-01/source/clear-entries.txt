Normally, by pressing 2nd ENTER repeatedly, you can cycle through some of the recent entries on the home screen. With the {{Clear Entries}} command, this history is cleared (only {{Clear Entries}} remains in the history). 

This can be used to free some memory, although it's recommended not to do this in a program (because clearing things without asking first isn't nice). Aside from that, maybe the only reason to use {{Clear Entries}} is to protect your privacy -- although someone looking at your entries will know you cleared something, so it's not that effective.
