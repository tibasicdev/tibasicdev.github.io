summary: 'Flood the board with a single color in the least amount of moves!'
description: "Click the blocks to fill the board with a single color. See if you can do it within a specified amount of moves! You should catch on pretty quickly ;) More info in the readme. Original game: http://unixpapa.com/floodit\n\nThe flood algorithm may be a tiny bit slow, but that is due to the limits of TI-Basic."
