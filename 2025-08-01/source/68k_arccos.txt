The {{cos^^-1^^()}} command returns the [https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseCosine.html inverse cosine] of an angle measure. Naturally, the result depends on the angle [[[68k:setmode|mode]]] the calculator is in: radian, degree, or (in AMS version 3.10) gradian. You can also use one of the ^^{{[[[68k:radian|r]]]}}^^, {{[[[68k:degree|°]]]}}, ^^{{[[[68k:gradian|G]]]}}^^ marks to specify an angle mode.

For many common angles, {{cos^^-1^^()}} can compute an exact result. Other angles, the calculator will leave alone unless it's in approximate mode (or unless you make it approximate), and then it will give a decimal approximation. As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{cos^^-1^^()}} can be used with complex numbers as well.

[[code]]
:cos⁻¹(1/2)
           π/3
:cos⁻¹(-1/2)
           2π/3
:cos(cos⁻¹(x))
           x

If {{cos^^-1^^()}} is applied to a list, it will take the inverse cosine of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The {{cos^^-1^^()}} of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the cosine of every element of the matrix. I hope that someone more qualified to talk about this updates this part of the page.
