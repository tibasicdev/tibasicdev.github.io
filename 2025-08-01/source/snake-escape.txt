Snake escape is similar to the game falldown, with the main difference being that you have to avoid a snake while collecting bananas. You can move left and right, and if you go off the screen, you will wrap around to the other side. In addition, if you go over a gap, you will fall down to the next level.

As you can see in the screenshot, the game runs on the home screen, and uses simple text for the snake and everything else. Of course, the main feature of the game is that it provides almost unlimited gameplay, since the gaps in each level are randomly generated and the levels keep going until you lose. The only controls in the game are left and right to move.
