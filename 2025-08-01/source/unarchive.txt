The UnArchive command moves a variable from the archive (also known as [[[glossary#R|ROM]]]) to [[[glossary#R|RAM]]]. A quick synopsis of the difference between the two:
* Data in the archive cannot be accessed, but it's protected from RAM clears (which may occur during battery removal if not done carefully); also, the archive can hold much more data.
* Data in RAM can be accessed for calculations, but it can also be deleted during a RAM clear or accidentally overwritten by another program.

It is, in general, not recommended to place real variables in the archive (since so many programs use them); also, some variables cannot be archived (see the [[[Archive]]] command for details). Although programs can be archived and unarchived, the Archive and UnArchive commands will not archive or unarchive programs from within a program. For the most part, [[[lists]]] are the only type of variable it makes sense to archive and unarchive in a program.

The UnArchive command doesn't do anything if the variable in question is already in RAM. However, there is no way to test if a variable is in RAM or archive, short of trying to access it and potentially getting an error.

+ Advanced Uses

The Archive and UnArchive commands can be used in conjunction for [[[saving]]] data as a program exits.

+ Optimization

The [[[SetUpEditor]]] command is often used in place of the UnArchive command when dealing with lists, for several reasons:
* using SetUpEditor will not prevent the program from working on a TI-83, like UnArchive will
* SetUpEditor will create a list with length 0 if it doesn't exist; UnArchive will throw an error
* SetUpEditor saves space in the program, since it can unarchive more than one list at a time, and doesn't require the little L in front

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#memory|ERR:MEMORY]]]** is thrown if there isn't enough memory available in RAM for the variable.
* **[[[errors#variable|ERR:VARIABLE]]]** is thrown when unarchiving a system variable or a application even if there is enough space.
