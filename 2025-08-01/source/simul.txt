Simul puts the calculator into simultaneous graphing mode. When multiple equations are enabled at the same time, simultaneous graphing mode graphs them at the same time (as opposed to [[[Sequential]]] mode, in which they will be graphed one after the other)

If you use a list in an equation, as with Y1={1,2,3}X, this will graph several equations that will always graph separately, regardless of this setting, which only affects multiple functions in different equation variables.
