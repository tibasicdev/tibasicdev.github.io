(Going through a door)\nNumbers: remove/place blocks\n2ND: Menu\n\nMenu:\nLOAD: Recallpic 8\nNEW: Generate new world\nSave: Storepic 8\nExit: Exit\nResume: Resume (can also load worlds from the graph screen I think)\n\nCompatible with Doors CS (it cost me 72 extra bytes for that 16x16 icon!)\n\nShould work with all calculators, tested on TI-nspire w/ 84+SE keypad.\n\n\n"
