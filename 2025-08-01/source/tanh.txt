Calculates the hyperbolic tangent of a value. The hyperbolic trig functions [[[sinh(]]], [[[cosh(]]], and tanh( are an analog of normal trig functions, but for a hyperbola, rather than a circle. They can be expressed in terms of real powers of [[[e-value|e]]], and don't depend on the [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] or [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] mode setting.

Like normal trig commands, tanh( works on lists as well, but not on complex numbers, even though the function is often extended to the complex numbers in mathematics.

+ Advanced Uses

The tanh( command can be used to approximate the sign function:

[[math]]
\operatorname{sgn} x=\begin{cases}-1&\text{if }x<0,\\0&\text{if }x=0,\\1&\text{if }x>0.\end{cases}
[[/math]]

As the absolute value of the input becomes large, the convergence is achieved at a point closer to zero. For the function to work as intended generally, numbers having lesser orders of magnitude need to be multiplied by a factor large enough for the argument to arrive at ±16.720082053122, which is the smallest input to produce ±1 (respectively) to fourteen digits of accuracy.

+ Formulas

The definition of the hyperbolic tangent is:
[[math]]
\tanh{x}=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}=\frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1}
