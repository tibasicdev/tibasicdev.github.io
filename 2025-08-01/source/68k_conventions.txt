Because there are several people contributing to this wiki, and each person undoubtedly has their own opinion and idea on how to format the content, we have come up with some conventions to use. These conventions are not set in stone, but please try to follow them unless you have a good reason not to. If you have a convention that you think the community should adopt, please add it to this list. (There is a separate set of conventions when making a [[[template:command-68k|command]]] or [[[template:routine-68k|routine]]] page.)

+++ Style Conventions

* Page headings are capitalized like an English paper would be capitalized.
* Follow the page structure with appropriate page headings, so a main point gets a first level heading and a secondary point gets a second level heading.
* Talk in third person when appropriate or first person when wanting to get the readers' attention.
* Follow the calculator manual when determining how to spell a word: in particular, home screen and graph screen should be spelled as two words instead of homescreen and graphscreen respectively.
* When referring to a TI-Basic command:
 * If the command has parentheses, use both of them -- e.g. [[[68k:getkey|getKey()]]] or [[[68k:gcd|gcd()]]]
 * Capitalize the command as it would appear in a tokenized program.
 * Make the first reference to the command on each page a link.
 * When talking about a block, make the first word a link -- e.g. [[[68k:try|Try]]]..EndTry.

+++ Code Conventions

* Write code as it would appear in a tokenized program.
* Include a colon (:) at the beginning of each line.
* Don't pad code with unnecessary blank lines or spaces.
* Don't include [[[68k:Prgm]]]..EndPrgm or [[[68k:func|Func]]]..EndFunc blocks.
 * The exception is when you're specifically listing the entire code of a program or function.
 * In this case, unless the name is also relevant, omit the name of the program.
 * If the program or function has arguments, list them as they would in the program editor, but without the name of the program.
* Check the [[[68k:character-codes|character codes]]] table for special symbols.
* In the program editor, the calculator screen can only show a set number of characters per line before it will start wrapping the characters around on to the next line. This is not very readable, so all the characters will be displayed on the same line (unless there is a tremendous number of characters).
