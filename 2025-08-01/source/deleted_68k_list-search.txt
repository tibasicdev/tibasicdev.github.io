At some point during your programing you may come up with a need to search a list for a piece of data, search multiple lists for data, and use that data.

+ How to Search





++ Quick Search


This code takes use of the For( command and states whether or not the number is in fact in the list.
If you wanted to know what position in the list that number was, you can simply do that by recalling Z (Since Z is the interval it is going up by, it shows how far into the list the number is found)

[[code]]
:Prompt D   				 //D is the number you want to find in the list
:For(Z,0,dim(L1  			 //Searches all the values up to the end of the list
:If L1(Z)=D
:Goto 1   					 //If value is found in list, Goto 1
:End
:Disp "VALUE NOT FOUND"   	 //If Value wasn't found after the search, displays this
:Stop
:Lbl 1
:Disp "VALUE FOUND AT",Z   	 //If Value was found at the end of the search, displays text and location in the list where it was found
:Stop
[[/code]]


++ Even Quicker Search

[[code]]
:if max(1/1+(abs(L-x)))=1			//L is the list, x is the value
[[/code]]


First the searched value is subtract from every item in the list. Now if the value was in the list, it's now 0, so 1/1+0 is 1. Every other value results in a lower number.

+ Old Lengthy Code

++ Simple:

Using a loop you can search each point in a list and have it show you where it is in the list

[[code]]
PROGRAM:SEARCH1
:Lbl 0
:Prompt D			//D is the number you want to find in the list
:0→Z
:dim(L1→T			//T is "length" of list AKA number of points
:While 1			//Start of Loop
:Z+1→Z
:If L1(Z)=D			//if found
:Goto 1			
:If Z=T			//if not in list **(must be after above if statement)**
:Goto 2			
:End				//End of loop 
:Lbl 1
:Disp Z			//Tells you Placement in list (and the fact dose exist in list)
:Pause
:Lbl 5
:Menu("Now What","New Search",0,"Exit",4
:End
:Lbl 2
:Menu("Point Not Found","Store Point",3,"New Search",0,"Exit",4
:End
:Lbl 3
:D→L1(T+1)
:Goto 5
:End
:Lbl 4
:Stop	
:End
[[/code]]

The above code is probably not fully optimized.

++ Two lists -- More Advanced

In reality all you need to do is add the star(ed) .

[[code]]
PROGRAM:SEARCH1
:Lbl 0
**:Prompt X**
**:Prompt Y**		
:0→Z
:dim(L1→T			//both first and second list must be same length or the checked list must be the shortest		
:While 1		
:Z+1→Z
:If L1(Z)=X	**and L2(Z)=Y**		
:Goto 1			
:If Z=T			
:Goto 2			
:End				
:Lbl 1
:Disp Z			
:Pause
:Lbl 5
:Menu("Now What","New Search",0,"Exit",4
:End
:Lbl 2
:Menu("Point Not Found","Store Point",3,"New Search",0,"Exit",4
:End
:Lbl 3
:X→L1(T+1)
**:Y→L2(T+1)**
:Goto 5
:End
:Lbl 4
:Stop	
:End
[[/code]]
The above code is probably not fully optimized

Not too hard, right?

++ More Complicated - Game use

So lets say you want to add "health" to that point you will need to add the star(ed) below .
Also at some point you will want to add the health to the points by doing :#→dim(L3)^^*^^ and :Fill(100,L3)^^**^^

^^*^^# is length of list
^^**^^100 is heath

Note: does not show what was removed

[[code]]
PROGRAM:SEARCH1
:Lbl 0
:Prompt X		//if used for a game these prompts should **not** be necessary
:Prompt Y	
:0→Z
:dim(L1→T		
:While 1		
:Z+1→Z
:If L1(Z)=X	and L2(Z)=Y	
:Goto 1			
:If Z=T			
:Goto 2			
:End				
:Lbl 1
**:L3(Z)-10→L3(3)**			
**:if L3(Z)≠0**
**:Goto (you decide)			//Not dead and exists where to?
**:if L3(Z)=0**				
**:Then**
**:#→L1(Z)**				//Somewhere "out of the way" so that he is not "there" anymore
**:#→L2(Z)**
**:Goto (you decide)**		//okay hes dead now what are you going to do?	
**:End**
:End
:Lbl 2
**:Goto (you Decide)**		//no enemy is there now what?
[[/code]]
The above code is probably not fully optimized.

The reason why this is difficult is because, well it requires a lot of thinking i can only show you a way but you must decide how it can be used.

+ Usage ideas

* Multi-Hit Enemys
* Level system (if (list)=# .... do __?__ damage)
* Find data points
