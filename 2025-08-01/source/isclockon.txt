The {{isClockOn}} command returns whether the clock on the TI-84+/SE calculators is on or off. The command will return 1 if the clock is enabled and 0 if it is not. You can store it to a [[[variable]]] for later use, or use it in [[[conditionals]]] and [[[loops]]] as part of the condition. For example, here is how you would check to see if the clock is on:

[[code]]
:If isClockOn
:Then
  (code if clock is on)
:Else
  (code if clock is off)
:End
[[/code]]
