The {{►DMS}} command can be used when displaying a real number on the home screen, or with the {{[[[Disp]]]}} and {{[[[Pause]]]}} commands. It will then format the number as an angle with degree, minute, and second parts.

[[code]]
30►DMS
	30°0'0"
100/9°►DMS
	11°6'40"
[[/code]]

It will also work when displaying a number by putting it on the last line of a program by itself. It does **not** work with {{[[[Output(]]]}}, {{[[[Text(]]]}}, or any other more complicated display commands.

Although {{►DMS}} is meant as a way to format angles in {{[[[degree-mode|Degree mode]]]}}, it doesn't depend on the angle mode chosen, only on the number itself. Note that entering a number as //degree//°//minute//'//second//" will also work, in any mode, and it will not be converted to radians in {{[[[radian-mode|Radian mode]]]}}.

+ Rounding to Nearest Second

If you'd prefer to not have seconds with decimal places, you can round your answer to the nearest second with the following formula:

[[code]]
round(Ans*3600,0)/3600►DMS
[[/code]]

Or a slightly shorter version:

[[code]]
round(Ans36,2)/36►DMS
[[/code]]

**Tip:** If you find yourself needing this formula regularly, put it into a Y= graphing-function as:

[[code]]
Y1=round(X36,2)/36
[[/code]]

And then you can call it from your home screen via:

[[code]]
Y1(123.45678►DMS
[[/code]]

* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown if the command is used somewhere other than the allowed display commands.
