The {{Fill(}} command takes an existing list or matrix variable and sets all its elements to a single number. It doesn't return anything and only works on already defined variables.

[[code]]
{5}→dim(L1)
Fill(2,L1)
L1
	{2 2 2 2 2}

{3,4}→dim([A])
Fill(1,[A])
[A]
	[[1 1 1 1]
	 [1 1 1 1]
	 [1 1 1 1]]
[[/code]]

{{Fill(}} is very fast: on a twenty-element real list, it takes only about 3.5 ms, much less than any vectorized list operation.

When {{Fill(}} is called on a list, the datatype of the list becomes the datatype of the number. That is, {{Fill(1,L₁)}} makes {{L₁}} a real list, and {{Fill(i,L₁)}} makes {{L₁}} a complex list.

+ Optimization

When creating a new list or matrix you want to fill with zeroes, it's better to delete it then create it with {{[[[dim(]]]}}, which will set all entries to 0, than to set its dimensions with dim( (which may not clear what was there before) then use Fill(.

+ Errors

On a TI-84+CSE, using {{Fill(List,List)}} will cause a RAM clear. For example: {{Fill({1,2,3},{1,2,3}}} will cause a RAM Clear. This does not apply on any other models, as they only give you argument and data type errors.
