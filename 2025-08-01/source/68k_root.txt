The root() command takes //n//^^th^^ roots: root(x,2) is the square root of x, root(x,3) is the cubic root, etc. (//n// doesn't have to be a whole number, or even real). Since root(x,n) is equivalent to x^(1/n), there was never any real need for this command, but it was added in the last AMS update for the Voyage 200 and TI-89 Titanium because users complained about not being able to do this calculation.

As far as complex roots are concerned: if taking a root of a real number, root() will return the real branch if there is one. If taking the root of a complex number, it will always return the principal branch.

+ Advanced Uses

The command uses the same routines as the [[[68k:power|^]]] operator, so it works in all the same ways. This means it can be applied to lists (element-wise), and to matrices either through repeated multiplication (e.g. if taking the 1/100^^th^^ root of a matrix, which ends up being its 100^^th^^ power) or by diagonalizing the matrix first (see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]] for mor information about this method). If you want to take the //n//^^th^^ root of every element of a matrix, use the [[[68k:dotpower|.^]]] command.

+ Optimization

You can save a few bytes of space by using root(x,n) instead of x^(1/n); however, this optimization is a bit dodgy. It requires AMS 3.10 to use, so if you're planning on releasing the program anywhere, it will only work on the TI-89 Titanium and the Voyage 200, and even then it might require updating the OS. It's probably not worth it, unless the program is for personal use only.
