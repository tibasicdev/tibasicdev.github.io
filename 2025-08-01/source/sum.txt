The sum( command calculates the sum of all or part of a list. 

When you use it with only one argument, the list, it sums up all the elements of the list. You can also give it a bound of //start// and //end// and it will only sum up the elements starting and ending at those indices (inclusive).

[[code]]
sum({1,2,3,4,5})
	15
sum({1,2,3,4,5},2,4)
	9
sum({1,2,3,4,5},3)
	12
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

If the value of //end// is the last element of the list, it can be omitted: 
[[code]]
sum({1,2,3,4,5},3,5)
can be
sum({1,2,3,4,5},3)
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if the starting or ending value exceed the size of the list, or are in the wrong order.
