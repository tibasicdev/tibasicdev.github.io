**Math Programs** are programs made to perform mathematic calculations or perform other functions. TI-BASIC is capable of creating programs to perform virtually any mathematical function.

For our example, we are going to make a simple program that will peform the quadratic equation. In other words, when the A, B, and C variables from a quadratic equation are inputed, it will solve for X. We start with the familiar quadratic equation:

[[code]]
PROGRAM:QUADRAT
:(-B+√(B²-4AC))/(2A→X
:(-B-√(B²-4AC))/(2A→Y
[[/code]]

Notice that because there is no +/- symbol in TI-BASIC, you must create two separate equations in case the solution is negative. The rest of the program is fairly simple.

[[code]]
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,"QUADRATIC EQUATE
:Output(2,1,"----------------
:Input "A=",A
:Input "B=",B
:Input "C=",C
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,"X=
:Output(1,3,X
:Output(2,1,"OR
:Output(2,3,Y
[[/code]]

With only these 13 lines of code, you have created a very powerful program that can save you a lot of time. Math programs can be created to do a wide array of tasks, including:

* Do conversions from Metric to English measurements
* Solve equations that come up a lot (much like the Quadratic Equation)
* Quickly find the average in a set of numbers
