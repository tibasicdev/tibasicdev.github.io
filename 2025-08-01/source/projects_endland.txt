A futuristic Role Playing Game with several abilities and a unique style of battle.
====
Yes, another RPG to add to the projects page.  

**Features:**
Utilizes the Horiz function, which splits the screen between text and graphics.  
Supports a dynamic inventory system similar to professional rpgs, with item stacking.
Runs decently on 83+ and almost too fast on 84/+/SE.  Seriously, the battle animations are pretty hard to make out.
A unique battle engine: you have to build up charge in battle to use stronger techniques and abilities
A graphical overworld and battle engine; this is not a text-based game.
Supports NPC's, random encounters, selling items, and most typical RPG stuff.

**Goals:**
3-4 areas and bosses
A storyline that makes sense
Finished by the end of summer--although that might be a bit overambitious

**Screenshots:**
(note that I'm having a bit of a problem with the run indicator.)
