{{ClrList}} sets the length of a list (or several lists) to 0. This is virtually equivalent to deleting the list, except for several differences:

* The list still exists -- it will be shown in the memory management menu and the list menu
* Calling the {{[[[dim(]]]}} command on it will return 0, rather than an error.
* {{ClrList}} can clear multiple lists at the same time

+ Advanced Uses

You might use {{ClrList}} when building up a list element by element and using {{dim(}} in the process:

[[code]]
:ClrList L1
:While 10>dim(L1
:Input X
:X→L1(1+dim(L1
:End
[[/code]]


+ Optimization

Using {{[[[DelVar]]]}} instead of {{ClrList}} allows you to save a tiny bit of memory (between 12 and 16 bytes) that {{ClrList}} doesn't delete, while keeping almost every aspect of the list clearing the same. If you are clearing several lists, you can separate them with commas as the arguments to {{ClrList}}, which can save space. Using {{ClrList}} is also substantially faster than {{DelVar}} if the list is going to be cleared many times.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** is thrown if you leave off the [[[l|∟]]] symbol when referring to a custom list (i.e., {{ClrList}} B will not work; you have to use {{ClrList}} ∟B).
