Given a matrix with at least as many columns as rows, the {{rref(}} command puts a matrix into reduced row-echelon form using Gaussian elimination.

This means that as many columns of the result as possible will contain a pivot entry of 1, with all entries in the same column, or to the left of the pivot, being 0.

+ Advanced Uses

The rref( command can be used to solve a system of linear equations. First, take each equation, in the standard form of [[$ a_1x_1+\dots + a_nx_n = b $]], and put the coefficients into a row of the matrix.

Then, use {{rref(}} on the matrix. There are three possibilities now:
* If the system is solvable, the left part of the result will look like the identity matrix. Then, the final column of the matrix will contain the values of the variables.
* If the system is inconsistent, and has no solution, then it will end with rows that are all 0 except for the last entry.
* If the system has infinitely many solutions, it will end with rows that are all 0, including the last entry.

This process can be done by a program fairly easily. However, unless you're certain that the system will always have a unique solution, you should check that the result is in the correct form, before taking the values in the last column as your solution. The {{[[[Matr►list(]]]}} command can be used to store this column to a list.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if the matrix has more rows than columns.
