The {{=}} (equal) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions, and tests to see if they are equal to each other. It will return 1 if they are, and 0 if they are not. When determining the order of operations, {{=}} will be executed after the [[[operators#math|math]]] operators, but it will be executed before the [[[operators#logical|logical]]] operators and in the order that it appears from left to right with the other [[[operators#relational|relational]]] operators.

1=0
           0
0->X
           0
3→Y
           3
X=Y
           0

+ Precision

The TI-84+ calculator appears to round numbers to 10 significant digits when checking for equality (even though behind the scenes in memory numbers are stored up to 14 digits). So for example:

[[code]]
0.99999999999=1       // True  (11 digits get rounded to 10)
0.9999999999=1        // False (with 10 digits not rounded)
99999.999999=100000   // True  (11 digits get rounded to 10)
99999.99999=100000    // False (with 10 digits not rounded)

+ Advanced Uses

Just like the other relational operators, = can take real numbers and lists for variables. In order to compare the lists, however, both must have the same dimensions; if they don't, the calculator will throw a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error. When comparing a real number to a list, the calculator will actually compare the number against each element in the list and return a list of 1s and 0s accordingly.

[[code]]
{2,4,6,8}={1,3,5,7
           {0 0 0 0}
5={1,2,3,4,5
           {0 0 0 0 1}

Besides real numbers and lists, {{=}} also allows you compare strings, matrices, and complex numbers. However, the variables must be of the same type, otherwise the calculator will throw a [[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]] error.

[[code]]
[[1,2,3]]=[[1,2,3
                      1
"HELLO"="WORLD
                      0
(3+4i)=(5-2i)
                      0
[[/code]]

When matrices are compared, the result is {{1}} if the matrices are identical. Both matrices must have the same dimensions, otherwise you will get a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error. Internally, the calculator compares values from the bottom right of each matrix, moving left across each row from bottom to top. If unequal elements are found, the calculator returns 0 without examining the rest of the matrix.

+ Optimization

When a variable is used in a conditional statement, and the only values that are possible for a variable are 1 and 0, you can get rid of the {{=}} sign and simply use the variable by itself.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you try to compare two different kinds of variables, such as a string and number or a list and matrix.
* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if you try to compare two lists or matrices that have different dimensions.
