randBin(//n//,//p//) generates a pseudorandom integer between 0 and //n// inclusive according to the binomial distribution B(//n//,//p//) - that is, //n// trials of an event with probability of success //p// are performed, and the number of successes is returned. randBin(//n//,//p//,//simulations//) performs the above calculation //simulations// times, and returns a list of the results. The expected (average) result is //n//*//p//.

//n// should be an integer greater than or equal to 1, while //p// should be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive.

//seed//→rand affects the output of randBin(

+ Formulas

The value of randBin( for a given seed can be expressed in terms of [[[rand]]]:

[[code]]
randBin(N,P)=sum(P>rand(N
[[/code]]

This is identical to the output of randBin( in the sense that for the same seed, both expressions will generate the same random numbers.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is triggered if the probability is not on the interval from 0 to 1.
