The {{Ans}} variable holds the last answer that was stored in the calculator. Because {{Ans}} is stored in a special storage area built-in to the calculator, and it is extensively used by the calculator, you cannot delete it. Ans is also useful; it can make your programs both smaller and faster:

* Unlike other variables which have a value type hard-coded in (i.e., a [[[strings|string]]] can only hold text, and [[[lists]]] and [[[matrices]]] can only hold numbers), {{Ans}} can take on whatever value you want: a real or complex, list, matrix, or string are all acceptable.

* Along with the [[[system-variables#finance|finance]]] variables, {{Ans}} is faster than the real, complex, list, matrix, and string variables; and subsequently, you should try to use it as much as possible.

One of the most common places to use {{Ans}} is in place of storing a value to a variable. Just paste the {{Ans}} variable to the location where the variable was called, and then when the expression is evaluated, the calculator will use the current value of {{Ans}}. Using the {{Ans}} variable allows you to eliminate the variable, which helps save a little or a lot of memory (depending on the type of variable and its size).

Instead of:

[[code]]
30+5A→B
Disp 25A,B
[[/code]]

A shorter version would be:

[[code]]
30+5A
Disp 25A,Ans
[[/code]]

(Since the {{Ans}} token is only 1 byte, you've just saved two bytes. In longer programs the savings can add up!)

The one major drawback to using {{Ans}} is that its current value is only temporary.

+ What commands modify Ans?

Whenever you:

* [[[Store]]] a value to a variable, such as {{1→X}}

* Place an expression or string on a line by itself, such as {{1+2}} or {{"Hello"}}

* Use the optional argument of the {{[[[Pause]]]}} command such as {{Pause X}}. {{Ans}} will be updated to the new value.

If you're performing multiple calculations across multiple variables, you might be better off storing each in a separate variable.

+ What commands do NOT modify Ans?

There are several cases in which changing the value of a variable does not modify {{Ans}}, thus preserving its current value for later use: 

* Asking a user for input via {{Prompt X}} or {{Input "X:",X}}

* Storing to an [[[system-variables#equation|equation variable]]] such as {{"X+1"→Y₁}}

* Using {{[[[DelVar]]]}} to delete a variable (i.e. set its value to zero, if it's a real variable)

* {{[[[For(]]]}} loops

* Changing the value with {{[[[IS>(]]]}} or {{[[[DS<(]]]}}

Also most other commands that do not modify variables will preserve {{Ans}}, including:

* {{ClrHome}}
* {{If ... Then ... Else ... End}}
* {{Disp}}
* {{Output()}}
* {{Repeat}}
* {{While}}
* {{Lbl}}
* {{Goto}}
* {{Menu()}}
* {{Pause}} (when there's no parameter following it, otherwise the parameter will be stored in {{Ans}}!)

Knowing these cases can be very useful, allowing you to make efficient use of {{Ans}} to store a result and re-use it in later lines rather than create a temporary variable for it.

+ Using Ans with Lists

{{Ans}} can be used to store lists and access individual items. Take the following example:

[[code]]
10→A
{11,22,33}
Disp Ans(1),Ans(2)
[[/code]]

In this example, the calculator is smart enough to know that {{Ans}} is currently holding a list, and so will interpret the {{(1)}} and {{(2)}} as accessing items from the list. As such it will display {{11}} and {{22}}. Trying to access {{Ans(4)}} will display an error.

However if we removed line 2 from the code above, {{Ans}} would instead be holding the value {{10}}, and as such {{Ans}} would be //multiplied// by 1 and 2, resulting in {{10}} and {{20}}.

The {{[[[augment]]]()}} function can also be used with {{Ans}} to add additional items to your list, for example:

[[code]]
{1,2}
augment(Ans,{3,4})
Disp Ans
[[/code]]

This will display {{{1 2 3 4}}}

+ Timing

Storing a real value into {{Ans}} takes approximately 1.0 ms. This does not include the time needed to compute or retrieve the value, which may be significant.
