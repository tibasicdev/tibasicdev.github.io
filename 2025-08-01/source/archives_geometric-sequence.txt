description: 'With the input of any two terms of a geometric sequence, and a desired term, the user can receive two outputs: the value of the desired term, and the sum of all terms from the first term to that one.  For example:  if you only knew the first and the third terms of the geometric sequence 1,2,4,8, and you wanted to find the fourth, you would first enter 1 and 3 for first and third terms, and then their respective values, 1 and 4.  Then you would enter the term you wanted, 4 for fourth term, and two numbers would be displayed: 8 (the fourth term) and 15 (1+2+4+8).'
