This command is used to calculate Poisson distribution probability. In plainer language, it solves a specific type of often-encountered probability problem, that occurs under the following conditions:
# A specific event happens at a known average rate (X occurrences per time interval)
# Each occurrence is independent of the time since the last occurrence
# We're interested in the probability that the event occurs a specific number of times in a given time.

The {{poissonpdf(}} command takes two arguments: The //mean// is the average number of times the event will happen during the time interval we're interested in. The //value// is the number of times we're interested in the event happening (so the output is the probability that the event happens //value// times in the interval).

For example, consider point on a city street where an average of 5 cars pass by each minute. What is the probability that in a given minute, 8 cars will drive by?

# The event is a car passing by, which happens at an average rate of 5 occurrences per time interval (a minute)
# Each occurrence is independent of the time since the last occurrence (we'll assume this is true, though traffic might imply a correlation here)
# We're interested in the probability that the event occurs 8 times in the time interval

The syntax in this case is:
[[code]]
:poissonpdf(5,8
[[/code]]
This will give about .065 when you run it, so there's a .065 probability that in a given minute, 8 cars will drive by.
