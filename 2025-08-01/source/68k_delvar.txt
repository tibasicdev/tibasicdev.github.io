The {{DelVar}} command deletes variables from existence, making them undefined again. This is a good way of [[[68k:setup-and-cleanup|cleaning up]]] at the end of a program, or of making sure that a variable is undefined before you use it in a symbolic expression. 

For {{DelVar}} to work, the variable must not be [[[68k:archive|archived]]] or [[[68k:lock|locked]]]. It also doesn't work on any program that's currently running, or on system variables.

There are two commands which might be a better alternative to {{DelVar}}, however. {{[[[68k:NewProb]]]}} deletes all 26 one-letter variables at once; however, it also clears things like the graph screen that you might want to see preserved. Declaring a variable as {{[[[68k:Local]]]}} at the beginning of a program prevents you from needing to delete it afterward, and it also makes sure you don't overwrite any existing variables.

Newer calculators have a {{[[[68k:DelType]]]}} command to delete all variables of a certain type (provided they're not locked or archived). This is risky: you'll almost certainly delete too much. It's better to use {{DelVar}}, even if you have to list a hundred variables to do it.

+ Advanced Uses

Assembly programs might allow you to "hide" programs (or other variables) from the variable menu. This is actually done by marking the variable in question as "in use", the way a currently-running program is marked. As a result, you won't be able to delete a hidden variable, and trying to will give the "Variable or Flash application in use" error.
