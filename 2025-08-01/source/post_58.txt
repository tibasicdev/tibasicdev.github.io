content: "One of my project ideas is something called the Chess Sandbox.  Essentially, it will be a chess program which has absolutely no validation checks; everything will be based on the honor system.  By doing this and making a wider variety of piece models available, users will be able to make up their own variations of chess and play them online.\n\nCurrently, my plan is to write this in Actionscript 3.0, but I have been contemplating the use of Java.  One of my fears is that I won't be able to figure out online capability and whatnot.  Creating live connections seems like it could be difficult; then again, it must be possible, considering Minecraft was written in Java and handles multiplayer fairly decently."
