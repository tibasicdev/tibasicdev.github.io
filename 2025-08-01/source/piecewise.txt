The {{piecewise(}} command is a new addition in the release of OS 5.3 for the TI-84 Plus CE. As implied, it allows for the graphing of piecewise functions in the Y= editor. The example code demonstrates how this works from within a program.

[[code]]
:ClrDraw
:Input "Y1=",Str1
:Input "Y2=",Str2
:Str1→Y1
:Str2→Y2
:FnOff
:"piecewise(Y1,X≥0,Y2,X<0→Y3
:DispGraph
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

One use of the {{piecewise(}} function is to evaluate an expression for a given value of X. For example:

[[code]]
:piecewise(X²+2,X≥0 
[[/code]]

This code will return the value of the expression if X≥0. So if X=0, then the program will return a value of 2. If X=3, it will return a value of 11. If X=-5, it will return an error.

+ Optimization

This command can simplify and compact the usage of piecewise expressions in programs. If you have less than 6 conditions that will never overlap, and they all affect a single variable, you can use the {{piecewise(}} command to make your code smaller, as shown below. Beware of comparability, though.

[[code]]
:If X<2
:Then
:4.5X→N
:Else
:8X+3→N
:End
can be
:piecewise(4.5X,X<2,8X+3,X≥2→N
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** is thrown if expressions are not defined.
* **[[[errors#data-type|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if a quotation mark is not placed before a piecewise command that is to be stored to an equation variable.
