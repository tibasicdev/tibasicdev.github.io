content: "When people visit and contribute to the forum, we want to make sure that they find it useful and an enjoyable place to be. To ensure that this happens, there are a few rules that you need to follow. Please read through and understand these rules, so that you know what we expect from you. Thank you.\n\n* Always try to be respectful of other posters, including their opinions, values, point-of-view, etc.\n* Always try to work with other posters instead of against them; this is a community and we are all here to help.\n* Don't post or request anything illegal or illicit, including ROMs, music, movies, p0rn, etc.\n* No cursing, spamming, or flaming! There is almost always a better way to express yourself.\n* Don't advertise your programs or websites, unless they are relevant and have some unique value to them.\n* Don't reply to old threads (last post is more than three months old) unless you have something new and valuable to contribute; start a new thread instead.\n* If a topic starts getting off-topic, start a new topic. Likewise, a topic should be placed in the appropriate category.\n* Don't try to pass off someone else's work as your own -- give credit to the author whenever possible.\n\nWe reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any post or thread when we deem it necessary.\n\n"
