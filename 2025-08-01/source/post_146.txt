content: "Thank you so so much for your optimizations. I really can't express how much I appreciate it; I'm literally ecstatic right now. \n\nAlso, I may have forgotten to mention this, but the ball does move at an angle, but you have to \"set it off\" first by moving the paddle exactly one pixel away from the ball. This is kind of hard to explain until you do it once. I made it this way on purpose to give skilled players an edge; they'll have the precision to set off trick shots and once a trick shot is off, it can't be undone until the next ball. Haha, if you were playing without knowing that you probably weren't having a lot of fun :P"
