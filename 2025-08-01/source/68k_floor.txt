The floor() command rounds a number down to the nearest integer less than or equal to the number. For instance, floor(π) returns 3, while floor(-π) returns -4. 

The command is an alias for [[[68k:int()]]]: they do the exact same thing. The calculator prefers using floor() (in fact, int() will be converted to floor() in symbolic expressions); int() is left over from earlier calculator models. Other rounding commands include:
* [[[68k:ceiling()]]] -- like floor(), but always rounds up (to the next higher integer).
* [[[68k:iPart()]]] -- truncates a number to just its integer part (or, if you prefer, rounds a number toward 0).
* [[[68k:round()]]] -- rounds to a specific place value, not just to an integer, but round(x,0) will round x to the nearest integer, up or down.

floor() can also be applied to complex numbers, lists, and matrices, rounding everything that there is to round in each of them.
