The tanh() command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicTangent.html hyperbolic tangent] of a number.

As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], tanh() can be used with complex numbers according to the rule that tanh(**//i//**x)=tan(x)***//i//** and tan(**//i//**x)=tanh(x)***//i//**. This rule only works in radian mode, and tanh() of a complex number will return a domain error when working in degrees or gradians.

Occasionally, tanh() can compute an exact result; most of the time, the calculator will leave an expression with tanh() alone unless it's in approximate mode (or you [[[68k:approx|force an approximation]]]). When tanh() is used with symbolic expressions, the calculator can go back and forth between the tanh() expression and its exponential equivalent.

If tanh() is applied to a list, it will take the hyperbolic tangent of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The tanh() of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the hyperbolic tangent of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.

+ Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic cotangent is, by analogy with [[[68k:tan()]]], the ratio of [[[68k:sinh()]]] and [[[68k:cosh()]]]:

[[include inc:68k-math eqn=\tanh{x}=\frac{\sinh{x}}{\cosh{x}} = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} = \frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1}]]
