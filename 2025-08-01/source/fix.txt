The {{Fix}} command puts the calculator in fixed-point display mode: all numbers will be displayed with a fixed number of digits (0-9) after the decimal, depending on the the number following the {{Fix}} command.

For example, after running the command {{Fix 3}}:

* {{1}} will be displayed as {{1.000}}
* {{3.14156}} will be displayed as {{3.142}} (rounded to 3 decimal places)

This could be useful if you're trying to display potentially fractional numbers in a limited amount of space. 

Use the {{[[[Float]]]}} command to undo the {{Fix}} command and only display decimal places when needed.

Unfortunately there is no direct command in TI-Basic to retrieve the current {{Fix}} setting (i.e., the number of decimal places currently set for display).

A note on more technical aspects: first, if more digits are available than are displayed, the calculator will round off the displayed number (but not its stored value), so 3.97 will be displayed as 4 in {{Fix}} 1 mode. Second, the {{Fix}} command can't force more than 10 significant digits to be displayed, so something like 123456789.1 will only display one decimal digit even in {{Fix}} 9 mode.

Finally, note that the {{[[[Float]]]}} and {{Fix}} commands only change the way numbers are //displayed//—they are saved in the same way in each case. Even if you're in {{Fix 0}} mode, the calculations are not done using integers, and in general, the calculations are still done using floating-point numbers no matter the number mode. The one exception is with [[[regression-models|regressions]]]: if you store a regression to an equation in {{Fix}} N mode, it will truncate the numbers involved before storing them to the equation, and as a result, the equation will be different.
