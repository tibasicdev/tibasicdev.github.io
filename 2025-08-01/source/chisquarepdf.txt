{{χ²pdf(}} is the χ² probability density function. 

Since the χ² distribution is continuous, the value of {{χ²pdf(}} doesn't represent an actual probability -- in fact, one of the only uses for this command is to draw a graph of the χ² curve. You could also use it for various calculus purposes, such as finding inflection points. 

The command takes two arguments: the value at which to evaluate the p.d.f., and //df//, the number of 'degrees of freedom'.
