Creates data variable //dataVar// based on the information used to plot the current graph. If dataVar is omitted, the data is stored in the
system variable sysData.

the increment for the independent value (ex. x for function or θ for polar graphs) is calculated based off the window settings. 

for 3D graphs, x remains constant until y increments through its range, this continues until x increments through its range.

When the Data/Matrix editor is started for the first time after BldData is run, //dataVar// or //sysData// will be the active variable.
