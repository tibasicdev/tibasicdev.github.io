The {{ClrTable}} command clears all calculations for the table screen shown if you press 2nd TABLE. That is, all already-calculated values in the table are cleared, and [[[system-variables#window|TblInput]]] is deleted. In {{[[[IndpntAuto]]]}} and {{[[[DependAuto]]]}} mode, this usually isn't noticeable because the table will be recalculated almost immediately when you next look at it (unless one of the entered functions is so complicated it takes a while to calculate). This mainly has an effect in {{[[[IndpntAsk]]]}} or {{[[[DependAsk]]]}} mode, where the corresponding parts of the table will be cleared entirely.

+ Advanced Uses

As a side effect, {{ClrTable}} seems to have all the effects of {{[[[ClrDraw]]]}} -- it clears the graph screen, and any equations or plots will be regraphed the next time the graph screen is displayed.

+ Command Timings

{{ClrTable}} and {{ClrDraw}} take the same amount of time to clear the screen.
