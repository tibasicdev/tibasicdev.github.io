[[include inc:68k-markup cmd=^^G^^]]

The ^^G^^ symbol used after an angle makes sure the angle is interpreted as being in gradians (an obscure angle measure in which a full circle is equal to 400 gradians); this functionality is present only on TI-89 Titanium or Voyage 200 calculators with AMS version 3.10. If the calculator is already in gradian mode, x^^G^^ is equal to x; in degree mode, x^^G^^ is equal to 9*x/10; and in radian mode, x^^G^^ is equal to π*x/200.

If you're using gradian angle measures extensively in a program, it's a better idea to use [[[68k:setMode()]]] to switch to gradian mode and not worry about this. However, there are two reasons you might want to use ^^G^^:
* If you need an angle in gradians only once or twice, don't bother changing the mode setting.
* In a function, you're forced to use ^^G^^, since setMode() isn't valid in a function. 

In gradian mode (no conversion is necessary, so no conversion is done):
[[code]]
:cos(100)
           1
:cos(100^G)
           1
:100^G
           100
[[/code]]

In degree mode:
[[code]]
:cos(100)
           cos(100)
:cos(100^G)
           1
:100^G
           90
[[/code]]
