tan(θ) calculates the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/tangent.html tangent] of the angle θ, which is defined by [[$ \tan \theta=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} $]]

The value returned depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] mode.  A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion from radians to degrees is angle*180/π and from degrees to radians is angle*π/180. The tan( command also works on a list of real numbers.

Since tangent is defined as the quotient of sine divided by cosine, it is undefined for any angle such that cos(θ)=0.

In radians:
[[code]]
tan(π/4)
    1
[[/code]]

In degrees:
[[code]]
tan(45)
    1
[[/code]]


+ Advanced Uses

You can bypass the mode setting by using the [[[degree-symbol|°]]] (degree) and ^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^ (radian) symbols. These next two commands will return the same values no matter if your calculator is in degrees or radians:

[[code]]
tan(45°)
    1
[[/code]]
[[code]]
tan(π/4¹ )
    1
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you supply a matrix or a complex argument.
* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if you supply an angle of π/2±nπ (in radians, where n is an integer) or 90±180n (in degrees, where n is an integer), or when the input is ≥1E12.
