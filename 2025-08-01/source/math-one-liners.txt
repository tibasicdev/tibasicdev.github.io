This page is dedicated to showcase small snippets of code that may be useful. These small routines are designed to accomplish tasks involving mathematics. Unless specified, output is in Ans.

**Primality of Positive Integer** – [[user jonbush]]; [[user lirtosiast]]

This routine works for 3≤X<10^^6^^ and returns 0 if X is composite, and 1 if X is prime.
If used in an If statement or place where the true value does not matter, you can remove the 0≠.
[[code]]
min(remainder(X,seq(A,A,2,1+√(X
[[/code]] This code can be modified to be faster if X is already known to be odd.
[[code]]
min(remainder(X,seq(A,A,3,1+√(X),2
[[/code]] The following code is faster for large or even X, and works for all 0≤X<3.99*10^^6^^.
[[code]]
min(X={2,3,5
If X≥7 and fPart(.5X
min(remainder(X,3+2cumSum(not(binompdf(int(.5√(X)),0
[[/code]]

**Euler's Totient Function Φ(n)** – [[user kg583]]

This routine calculates the value of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function Euler's Totient Function] for any integer X>3.
[[code]]
2+sum(seq(gcd(X,A)=1,A,2,X-2
[[/code]]

**Number of Factors** – [[user kg583]]

This routine calculates the number of factors for any integer X>2. A factor is any integer can divide X with no remainder (including 1 and X).
[[code]]
2+Xmean(seq(not(remainder(X,A),A,2,X-2
