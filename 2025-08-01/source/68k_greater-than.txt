The > operator compares two values, returning true if the left side is greater, and false otherwise. It is a basic building block of the conditions used by commands such as [[[68k:If]]], [[[68k:when()]]], and [[[68k:While]]]. The results of > and the other relational operators ([[[68k:equal|=]]], [[[68k:not-equal|≠]]], [[[68k:greater-than-or-equal|≥]]], [[[68k:less-than|<]]], and [[[68k:less-than-or-equal|≤]]]) can be combined with the [[[68k:and]]], [[[68k:or]]], [[[68k:xor]]], and [[[68k:not]]] operators to create more complicated conditions.

It returns a single value for most types of data, and returns false if the two sides are mismatched in type: comparing a single number to a list, for instance, or comparing two lists that are of a different size. The only exception is when comparing two [[[68k:lists]]] or two [[[68k:matrices]]] of the same size: in that case, it compares them element-by-element, and returns a list or matrix of true/false values.

If either side or both contains undefined variables, > will wait to return a value. You can do math with the resulting inequality, and if an operation makes sense, it will be applied to both sides: for instance, if x>y, then you can negate it to get -x<-y. An operation will not be applied to both sides if it wouldn't be consistent with the previous inequality: for example, you can't square both sides, since even if x>y the comparison between x^2 and y^2 could go in any order. You can also extract the two halves of the inequality with [[[68k:left()]]] and [[[68k:right()]]].

+ Advanced Uses

The > operator can also compare strings. It does so by comparing the [[[68k:character codes]]] of each character, and orders the strings by the first difference it finds. This ideally means that the strings are ordered by dictionary order: for example, "apple">"aardvark", since it would come later in the dictionary. 

However, the problem is that all uppercase letters have a smaller character code than lowercase letters, so this only holds true if the strings are the same case. Otherwise, strange results can happen: for instance, "aardvark">"Apple", since "a" comes after "A".
