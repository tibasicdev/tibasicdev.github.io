The / operator divides two numbers, variables, or expressions. It  has higher priority than [[[68k:add|+]]] and [[[68k:subtract|-]]], so it will be done before them; it has the same priority as [[[68k:multiply|*]]].

[[code]]
:x/y
		x/y
:2/2
		1
[[/code]]

Though division by zero isn't allowed, it will not cause an error; instead it returns the value undef -- short for "undefined." Dividing by a variable that hasn't been defined yet will cancel it if it occurs on both sides: 5*x/x will equal 5; a short warning will be given to the effect that this isn't valid for x=0.
