The last logical operator available on the 83 series takes only one value as input.  **not(** comes with its own parentheses to make up for this loss.  Quite simply, it negates the input: False becomes True (1) and True returns False (0).   not( can be nested; one use is to make any True value into a 1.
[[code]]:not(0)
           1

:not(-20 and 14)

           0

:not(not(2))
           1[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

not(not(X)) will make any value X into 1 if it's not 0, and will keep it 0 if it is.

+ Optimization

not(X) and X=0 have the same truth value, but not( is shorter if the closing parenthesis is omitted:

[[code]]
:If A=0
can be
:If not(A
[[/code]]
