{{invNorm(}} is the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution function: given a probability, it will give you a z-score with that tail probability. The probability argument of {{invNorm(}} is between 0 and 1; 0 will give {{-1[[size 75%]]E[[/size]]99}} instead of negative infinity, and 1 will give {{1[[size 75%]]E[[/size]]99}} instead of positive infinity

There are two ways to use {{invNorm(}}. With three arguments, the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution for a probability with specified mean and standard deviation is calculated. With one argument, the standard normal distribution is assumed (zero mean and unit standard deviation). For example:

[[code]]
for the standard normal distribution
:invNorm(.975

for the normal distribution with mean 10 and std. dev. 2.5
:invNorm(.975,10,2.5
[[/code]]

+ Advanced

This is the only inverse of a probability distribution function available (at least on the TI-83/84/+/SE calculators), so it makes sense to use it as an approximation for other distributions. Since the normal distribution is a good approximation for a binomial distribution with many trials, we can use {{invNorm(}} as an approximation for the nonexistent "invBinom(". The following code gives the number of trials out of {{N}} that will succeed with probability {{X}} if the probability of any trial succeeding is {{P}} (rounded to the nearest whole number):

[[code]]
:int(.5+invNorm(X,NP,√(NP(1-P
[[/code]]

You can also use {{invNorm()}} to approximate the [[[invt | inverse of a t-distribution]]]. Since a normal distribution is a t-distribution with infinite degrees of freedom, this will be an overestimate for probabilities below 1/2, and an underestimate for probabilities above 1/2.

+ Formulas

Unlike the {{[[[normalpdf(]]]}} and {{[[[normalcdf(]]]}} commands, the {{invNorm(}} command does not have a closed-form formula. It can however be expressed in terms of the [wikipedia:Error_function inverse error function]:
[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{invNorm}(p) = \sqrt{2}\,\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2p-1)
]]

For the arbitrary normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ:
[[include inc:math
|eqn= \operatorname{invNorm}(p,\mu,\sigma)=\mu+\sigma\operatorname{invNorm}(p)
]]
