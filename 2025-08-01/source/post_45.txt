content: "I don't know if any of you have heard of it, but TI-Concours 2013 recently opened up. Ti-Concours is an annual competition and is typically a French competition (Concours = Competition). Last year they bridged a language barrier and opened it up to the English speaking community as well. It was a success and so they have once again opened it up to everybody. This year's categories are:\n* TI-BASIC z80\n* TI-BASIC 68k\n* Axe\n* z80 Assembly\n* Nspire Lua\nThe competition has some interesting components in the final rounds including an interview in English or French, depending on your language and a three hour test to see what you can come up with in a short period of time. The rest of the competition is split up over a period of about six weeks where TI-BASIC (68k and z80)  and Axe have two challenges that last one week and the other two categories have one challenge over two weeks. There is some overlap, but the schedule looks like this:\n[[image http://www.ti-concours.com/content/dates.png]]\n\nThere is nothing to lose and the prizes are pretty nice! Last year they got surprised with being able to dole out even more prizes (I think up to fifth place in some categories). If you want to sign up before the competition starts, you can [http://www.ti-concours.com/inscription.php register here.]\n\nI hope at least some of you can join! There are currently only 4 entrants for TI-BASIC (z80) and two for 68K BASIC!"
