! is the factorial function, where //n//! = //n//*(//n//-1)! and 0! = 1, //n// an nonnegative integer. The function also works for arguments that are half an odd integer and greater than -1/2: [[$ (-\frac1{2})! $]] is defined as [[$ \sqrt{\pi} $]] and the rest are defined recursively. 69 is the largest number for which the calculator can perform the operation.

The combinatorial interpretation of factorials is the number of ways to arrange //n// objects in order.
