Another important class of math functions deals with powers, logarithms, and exponents.

[[toc]]

+ [[[power|^]]] operator

This operator, found on the keyboard, is the exponent operator. It will raise a number to a power.

+ ^^[[[inverse|-1]]]^^, ^^[[[2]]]^^, ^^[[[3]]]^^

These are shortcuts for the reciprocal, square, and cube of a number, respectively. ^^-1^^ and ^^2^^ can be found on the keyboard, while ^^3^^ can be pasted by pressing MATH, 3.

+ Logarithms: [[[log(]]], [[[ln(]]]

The [[[log(]]] and [[[ln(]]] functions, both available from the keyboard, will calculate the logarithms to base 10 and base e, respectively.
To get logarithms to other bases, use the following formula:

[[code]]
:log(x)/log(b)
[[/code]]
where //b// is the desired base.

A useful use of log( is to determine how many digits an integer has. An integer //n// will have
[[code]]
:int(log(abs(n)))+1
[[/code]]
digits in base 10.

+ [[[ten-exponent|10^(]]], [[[e-exponent|e^(]]], [[[e-ten|E]]]
These functions can be found on the keyboard, by pressing 2nd plus the respective logarithm key. Of course you could always type these out one character at a time, but using shortcuts takes less bytes. The [[[e-ten|E]]] (EE on the keypad) denotes and integer power of 10, and is commonly used for scientific notation. E cannot be used with variables or fractional exponents, but it is about twice as fast as 10^(.

+ Roots: [[[square-root|√(]]], [[[cube-root|³√(]]], [[[xroot|ˣ√(]]]

These functions take the square root, cube root, and nth root of a number, respectively.

[[code]]
:5ˣ√(2)
[[/code]]
will give the same result as
[[code]]
:2^(1/5)
[[/code]]
namely, the 5th root of 2.
