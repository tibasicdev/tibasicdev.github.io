The TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus SE, which have a built-in hardware clock, introduce several commands for dealing with time. Some of these rely on the built-in clock, while others are used for formatting times and dates and could technically have been introduced on earlier calculators. However, the only time/date command that is available on the pre-84 calculators is [[[dbd(]]].

All of these commands except dbd( can be found only through the command catalog (2nd CATALOG). [[[dbd(]]] can also be found in the Finance menu -- 2nd FINANCE on the TI-83, and APPS 1:Finance... on the TI-83+ or higher.

Despite its name, the [[[Time]]] command has nothing to do with the clock. It is a mode setting for sequence graphs.

++ Low-Level Commands

* **[[[startTmr]]]** -- This command returns the current value of a timer that is updated every second when the clock is enabled. This value doesn't correspond to any actual time, but can be used with [[[checkTmr(]]] to get a time difference.
* **[[[checkTmr(]]]** -- checkTmr(X) is equivalent to [[[startTmr]]]-X. This can be used to get the time elapsed since startTmr was used.
* **[[[ClockOn]]]**, **[[[ClockOff]]]** -- Enables or disables the hardware clock.
* **[[[isClockOn]]]** -- Tests if the clock is enabled or not.

++ Time Commands

* **[[[setTime(]]]** -- Sets the current time, in hours, minutes, and seconds. If the clock is enabled, this time will be updated every second.
* **[[[getTime]]]** -- Returns the current time as the list {hours, minutes, seconds}. This command is unaffected by time format.
* **[[[setTmFmt(]]]** -- Sets the time format - 12 hour, or 24 hour.
* **[[[getTmFmt]]]** -- Returns this time format setting.
* **[[[getTmStr(]]]** -- Returns the current time as a string, affected by time format (though you can override it with an optional argument).

[[/div]]

++ Date Commands 

* **[[[setDate(]]]** -- Sets the current date (year, month, and day). If the clock is enabled, this date will be updated as needed.
* **[[[getDate]]]** -- Returns the current date as the list {year, month, day}. This command is unaffected by date format.
* **[[[setDtFmt(]]]** -- Sets the date format - 1 for month/day/year, 2 for day/month/year, or 3 for year/month/day.
* **[[[getDtFmt(]]]** -- Returns this date format setting.
* **[[[getDtStr(]]]** -- Returns the current date as a string, affected by date format (though you can override it with an optional argument).

++ Time/Date Manipulation

* **[[[timeCnv(]]]** -- Converts a number of seconds into a list of {days, hours, minutes, seconds} representing the same time lapse.
* **[[[dayOfWk(]]]** -- Returns the day of week (Sunday through Saturday encoded as 1 through 7) of a specified date.
* **[[[dbd(]]]** -- Returns the number of days between two dates -- this command is available on all calculators, not just the 84+/SE.
