In general, omitting all the variables for a section is the way to go if you don't want the section to be displayed. The exception is "calculator compatibility" - omitting the variables for that section will display the default message (compatible with all calculators).

++ |picture=
If the image is embedded on the same page, then only the full name of the image is to be written here. Otherwise, simply paste the full URL of the image.

++ |summary=
Just type in a brief description of the command.

++ |syntax=
Enter the general syntax of the command.


++ |compatibility

If the command works on all calculators, simply say "All calculators." Otherwise, specify which calculator(s) the command is compatible with.

Only one option can be applied (and they are exclusive of each other), otherwise unpredictable results may occur.
