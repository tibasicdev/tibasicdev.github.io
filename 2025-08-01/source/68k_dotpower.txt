The .^ operator is generally the same as [[[68k:power|^]]], except when dealing with matrices. While ^ does quite a lot of matrix-specific stuff (check out its page for more information), .^ just applies it element-by-element:
[[code]]
:[a,b;c,d] .^ 2
           [a^2  b^2]
           [c^2  d^2]
[[/code]]

The command can handle any choice of matrix and scalar as the base and exponent. However, if you're raising a constant number to a matrix power, be careful that the dot in .^ is not confused for a decimal point, by adding extra spaces:
[[code]]
:2.^[a,b;c,d]
           Error: Data type
:2 .^ [a,b;c,d]
           [2^a  2^b]
           [2^c  2^d]
[[/code]]

Although this doesn't come up often, be aware that .^, like ^, is evaluated from right to left: a.^b.^c is calculated as a.^(b.^c), not as (a.^b).^c.
