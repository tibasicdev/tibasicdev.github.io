[[include inc:68k-markup cmd=^^r^^]]

The ^^r^^ symbol used after an angle makes sure the angle is interpreted as being in radians. If the calculator is already in radian mode, x^^r^^ is equal to x; in degree mode, x^^r^^ is equal to 180*x/π; and in gradian mode, x^^r^^ is equal to 200*x/π.

If you're using radian angle measures extensively in a program, it's a better idea to use [[[68k:setMode()]]] to switch to radian mode and not worry about this. However, there are two reasons you might want to use ^^r^^:
* If you need an angle in radians only once or twice, don't bother changing the mode setting.
* In a function, you're forced to use ^^r^^, since setMode() isn't valid in a function. 

Make sure to use parentheses around an expression like (π/3)^^r^^, since π/3^^r^^ will be interpreted as π/(3^^r^^), and the conversion will be done incorrectly.

In radian mode (no conversion is necessary, so no conversion is done):
[[code]]
:sin(π/6)
           1/2
:sin((π/6)^r)
           1/2
:π^r
           π
[[/code]]

In degree mode:
[[code]]
:sin(π/6)
           sin(π/6)
:sin((π/6)^r)
           1/2
:π^r
           180
[[/code]]
