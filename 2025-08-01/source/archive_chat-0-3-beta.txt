description: "A chatprogramm for 2 calculators with a complex user interface. Both users have their own names and can even write messages at the same time.\n\nWhen you've send a message and the calculator screens \"press enter\", wait 1 sec (the other calc needs time to update). This is the only bug I know in this program and I hope I'll find a solution soon."
