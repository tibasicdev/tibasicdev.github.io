The ln( command computes the natural logarithm of a value -- the exponent to which the constant //[[[e-value|e]]]// must be raised, to get that value. This makes it the inverse of the //[[[e-exponent|e^(]]]// command.

ln( is a real number for all positive real values. For negative numbers, ln( is an imaginary number (so taking ln( of a negative number will cause [[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]] to be thrown in [[[real-mode|Real]]] mode), and of course it's a complex number for complex values. ln( is not defined at 0, even if you're in a complex mode.

+ Advanced Uses

Using either the ln( or the [[[log(]]] command, logarithms of any base can be calculated, using the identity:
[[math]] 
\log_b{x} = \frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{b}} = \frac{\log{x}}{\log{b}} 
[[/math]]

So, to take the base B log of a number X, you could use either of the following equivalent ways:
[[code]]
:log(X)/log(B)
[[/code]]
[[code]]
:ln(X)/ln(B)
[[/code]]

This is the exponent to which B must be raised, to get X.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** when calculating ln(0).
* **[[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]]** if taking ln( of a negative number in [[[real-mode|Real]]] mode.
