At the time of this revision, there is very little known documentation on how to program Nspire calculators. Below is a list of resources that contain information on Nspire Basic.

* [*https://epsstore.ti.com/OA_HTML/csksxvm.jsp?nSetId=93482 This article details how to make a program on Nspire family calculators.]

* [*https://education.ti.com/en/activities/ti-codes/nspire TI Codes by Texas Instruments contains some basic information on how to program an Nspire.]

* [*https://education.ti.com/html/webhelp/EG_TINspireCode/EN/index.html The TI-Nspire Programming eGuide, made by TI, should have documentation of most Nspire commands.]

* [*http://www.mathguy.us/Handbooks/TI_nSpire_CX_CAS.pdf This PDF mostly describes how to use an Nspire CX CAS, but contains some programming information as well.]

* [*https://education.ti.com/en/resources/lua-scripting?category=overview This page provides some basic information on how to do Lua Scripting on an Nspire.]

* [*http://www.johnhanna.us/TI-nspire.htm Former teacher John Hanna has made some very impressive Nspire programs (though most appear to be in Lua, not TI-Basic), so check these out if you're looking for example Nspire programs and games.]

* [*https://www.tinspireapps.com/resources/How_to_program_the_TI-Nspire.pdf This PDF shows some basics of making Nspire programs, then demonstrates how to make complex math programs.]

* [*https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYmatWdT44uggIqCzO1S018wKB9AU0zwR This YouTube playlist has several videos showing how to do algebraic things on Nspire calculators.]

* [*http://tibasic.wikia.com/wiki/TI-Basic_Nspire_Programming This page by TI-Basic Wikia shows some of the basics of Nspire programming.]

* [*http://compasstech.com.au/TNSINTRO/TI-NspireCD/Start_Here.html Compass Learning Technologies has several pages on how to use an Nspire, including a page on programming.]

* [*https://hackspire.org/index.php/Hackspire_Home This wiki contains some information on a variety of Nspire topics, including how to hack an Nspire.]

* [*https://inspired-lua.org/ This site details Lua scripting for Nspire calculators.] (As a side note, the more research I do, the more it seems that Lua scripting is the easiest way to make advanced Nspire programs...)

* [*http://phs.princetonk12.org/Teachers/gelia/StudentResources/APStat/raymondRozenCoinTossing.pdf This PDF shows how to make a coin tossing program, and contains the code for a program that simulates the rolling of dice.]

* [*http://thebooksout.com/downloads/ti-nspire-cx-programming-guide-bsoftb.pdf This is a guide to programming an Nspire CX, but it isn't free.]

* [*https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tinspire/l7pV7onn8ZU This is a Google Groups discussion on programming an Nspire. I wouldn't post anything there, however, since it has been nearly a decade since the most recent post.]

* [*https://www.scribd.com/presentation/168593221/TI-Nspire-Programming You'll have to download this slideshow on Nspire programming, but you can access it for free if you activate Scribd's 30 day free trial.]

* [*https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10720 This Cemetech discussion has information on doing Micro Python programming on an Nspire.] 

* [*http://focusky.com/dcup/zmck Focusky has the same slideshow that Scribd does, and you can view it for free if you still have a computer that supports Adobe Flash Player.]

* [*https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15309 This article by TI-Planet details how to program Nspires in Micro Python.]

* [*https://www.manualslib.com/manual/325947/Ti-Ti-Nspire.html?page=327#manual This Nspire manual over at manualslib has some information on programming.]

* [*https://codewalr.us/index.php?topic=1249.0 This discussion over at Code Walrus has information on programming an Nspire with a Squirrel language variant.]
