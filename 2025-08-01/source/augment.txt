The {{augment(}} command is used to combine two lists or two matrices into one. For lists, this is done the obvious way: adding the elements of the second on to the elements of the first. For example:
[[code]]
augment({1,2,3,4},{5,6,7
	{1 2 3 4 5 6 7}
[[/code]]

The lists //must// have at least one value. If you attempt to {{augment(L₁,L₂)}} and either of the lists are empty, you will receive an error. If you're using this within a program, you may want to use {{[[[dim]]]()}} to check the size before performing an {{augment}}.

For matrices, the columns of the second matrix are added after the columns of the first matrix: an R by C matrix augmented with an R by D matrix will result in an R by (C+D) matrix. For example:

[[code]]
augment([[1][2]],[[3][4]
	[[1 3]
	 [2 4]]
[[/code]]

+ Combining 3 or more lists

The {{augment()}} command only accepts two parameters. If you need to combine 3 or more lists, you can nest the {{augment}} calls.

[[code]]
This will NOT work:  augment(L₁,L₂,L₃)
But this will:       augment(augment(L₁,L₂),L₃)
[[/code]]

Just be sure that all lists have at least 1 value to prevent errors.

+ Advanced Uses

Use the {{^^[[[transpose|T]]]^^}} (transpose) command if you want to combine two matrices vertically, rather than horizontally. For example:

[[code]]
augment([[1,2]]T,[[3,4]]T)T
	[[1 2]
	 [3 4]]
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

You may be tempted to use {{augment(}} to add one element to the end of a list:

[[code]]
augment(L1,{X→L1
[[/code]]

However, the following way is faster and more memory-efficient while the program is running (although it increases the program's size):

[[code]]
X→L1(1+dim(L1
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you try to augment a single number to a list, a common error -- use {X instead of X.
* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if you try to augment two matrices with a different number of rows.
* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if one of the arguments is a list with dimension 0, or if the result would have dimension over 999 (for lists) or 99x99 (for matrices).
