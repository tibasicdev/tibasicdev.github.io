The classic game of Dots (aka Boxes), popularized by the pencil & paper version, where two or more people take turns connecting a grid of dots with lines in an attempt to form complete boxes. The player who completes the most boxes wins! Features include: 2-9 players, customizable grid width/height, extremely intuitive game controls, and even a preview cursor which shows the user what a line would look like if placed in the current position.
