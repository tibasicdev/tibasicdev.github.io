The & operator joins two strings together, one after the other, returning one large string.

[[code]]
:"Hello"&"World"
           "HelloWorld"
:5→n
:"The value of n is "&string(n)
           "The value of n is 5"
[[/code]]

Appending strings is very useful when you want to display text. If you want to display more than one string on the same line, for instance with the [[[68k:Text]]] command, you'll need to use & to combine the strings.

By default, & doesn't put in any separation between the strings, which can look weird: you can see this in the above example, where joining "Hello" and "World" made "HelloWorld". With multiple uses of &, you can put in any separator you like:
[[code]]
:"Hello"&" "&"World"
           "Hello World"
[[/code]]

If you want to use & to build up a string from scratch, start with "" -- the empty string.
