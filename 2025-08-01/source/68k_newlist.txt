The {{newList()}} command returns a list of a specific length that is filled entirely with zeroes.
[[code]]
:newList(3)
           {0  0  0}
:newList(5)
           {0  0  0  0  0}
:newList(0)
           {}
[[/code]]

This can be easily expanded to returning a list filled with any value: to return a list filled with a value x, just add x to the result of {{newList()}}. This works for strings as well, since "Hello"+0 simplifies to "Hello".

+ Advanced Uses

{{newList()}} can be used for making a comparison between a single value and a list. Normally, something like {1,2,3,4}=2 simply returns "false", since 2 is not a list and {1,2,3,4} is. To do a comparison element-by-element, use {{newList()}} to turn the single value into a list: in this case, 2+{{newList(4)}}. Comparing {1,2,3,4} to 2+{{newList(4)}} will return {false, true, false, false} (you might use {{[[[68k:when()]]]}} to get a single value out of this list).

This works to extend other operations to a number and a list, as well, though comparisons are the most useful application of this technique, since most operations already work this way.

+ Optimization

In many cases, an expression with {{newList()}} can be used to optimize a {{[[[68k:seq()]]]}} command. First, observe that the simple
[[code]]
:seq(k,k,1,n)
[[/code]]
which will return the list {1,2,3,...,n}, can be replaced by
[[code]]
:cumSum(1+newList(n))
[[/code]]
The result is about twice as fast.

This is useful because many {{seq()}} expressions can be expressed using something like {{seq(k,k,1,n)}}. For example:
[[code]]
:seq(k^2,k,1,n)

can be

:seq(k,k,1,n)^2

which is

:cumSum(1+newList(n))^2
[[/code]]
This rearrangement is not always possible, but when it is, it gives a significant improvement in speed, with no real difference in size. 

Here is a more complicated example (which is a sequence of probabilities with the binomial distribution). Notice the use of the {{[[[68k:with]]]}} operator.
[[code]]
:seq(nCr(n,k) p^k (1-p)^(n-k),k,1,n)

can be

:nCr(n,a) p^a (1-p)^(n-a)|a=cumSum(1+newList(n))
[[/code]]
