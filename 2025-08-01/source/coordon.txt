When moving a cursor on a screen, it's possible for the calculator to display the coordinates of the current point (either polar or rectangular coordinates, depending on which of {{[[[RectGC]]]}} or {{[[[PolarGC]]]}} is set). The {{CoordOn}} command turns on this option (to disable it, use the {{[[[CoordOff]]]}} command).

The coordinates are displayed in practically every situation when you're moving a cursor on the graph screen, even including the {{[[[Trace]]]}}, {{[[[Input]]]}} or {{[[[Select(]]]}} commands in a program. The interactive mode of {{[[[Text(]]]}} and the {{Pen}} tool are the exceptions -- this is because these two situations involve a pixel coordinate, and not a point.
