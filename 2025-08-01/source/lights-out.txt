Lights Out is a fun puzzle game that involves trying to turn off all of the lights. While that sounds easy, when you select a square it inverts not only the square itself, but the four squares surrounding it (i.e., if a square is on, it will be turned off, and vice versa).

The game features three different modes of play -- normal, random, and custom -- which means it will be staying on your calculator for a while until you beat it. Speaking of which, when you win the game, you get a nice win sequence that is reminiscent of the classic Tiger handheld version.

Unlike some of the other lights out clones, this version runs strictly on the graph screen, and features a nice graphical interface. The game uses the standard controls: the arrow keys move the cursor, while 2nd/ENTER makes a selection in the menu and on the game board.
