NINA.
It was our first version of AI.
We made it analytical.
Logical.
Able to make decisions and rationale based on external stimuli.

I am the last Scientist on the planet Earth.
And, I have the strangest ability.

By constantly exchanging my mechanical parts, I can never rust.

Thought I was human?
