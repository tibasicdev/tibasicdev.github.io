The {{PtOn}} command draws a point on the graph screen. It uses point coordinates, which means that the result is determined by [[[68k:system-variables#window|window variables]]]: the x-coordinate must be between xmin and xmax, and the y-coordinate must be between ymin and ymax (with (xmin,ymin) being the bottom left and (xmax,ymax) the top right corner).

Unlike pixel commands such as {{[[[68k:PxlOn]]]}}, however, {{PtOn}} won't give an error if the coordinates happen to be outside these bounds -- it simply won't have any effect (exactly the same as the 83+ version of {{[[[pt-on | Pt-On]]]}}).

+ Advanced Uses

{{PtOn}} can also be used with two lists of the same size. In that case, it will draw the points for every pair of elements (xlist[n], ylist[n]). This can be used as an alternative to plots (see {{[[[68k:NewPlot]]]}}) to plot a set of points.
