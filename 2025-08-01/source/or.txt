**or** takes two numbers or expressions, and checks to see if //either one// is True.  If both are False, it returns 0.  If at least one is True, it returns 1.  **or** is commutative (i.e. the order of arguments does not matter). As with **[[[and]]]**, you can use variables and expressions, and use multiple **or**'s together.
