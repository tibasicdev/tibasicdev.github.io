version: '1.0'
summary: 'In collect, you go around and collect the dots that appear as soon as you eat the previous one. It is almost exactly the same as snake, with the major difference that the dot does NOT grow. If you move 100 times, or hit one of the walls, it''s game over. For further info, look at the readme. Remember, this is a beta version, so it is lacking in many features that I will add later.'
