Calculates the hyperbolic sine of a value. The hyperbolic trig functions sinh(, [[[cosh(]]], and [[[tanh(]]] are an analog of normal trig functions, but for a hyperbola, rather than a circle. They can be expressed in terms of real powers of [[[e-value|e]]], and don't depend on the [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] or [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] mode setting.

Like normal trig commands, sinh( works on lists as well, but not on complex numbers, even though the function is often extended to the complex numbers in mathematics.
