The {{Full}} command cancels the effects of either {{[[[Horiz]]]}} or {{[[[G-T]]]}}.

{{Full}} is usually used either at the beginning and/or ending of a program. It is used at the beginning to ensure that the screen mode is {{Full}}, the standard setting. It is used at the end if the screen mode was changed in the middle of the program (as [[[cleanup|clean up]]]).
