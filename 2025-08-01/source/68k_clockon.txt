The {{ClockOn}} command turns on the calculator's clock, used by most [[[68k:time and date]]] commands. Only when the clock is on, will the value returned by {{[[[68k:startTmr()]]]}}, {{[[[68k:getTime()]]]}}, and other commands actually change with the passage of time. If you write a program that uses any of these commands, be sure to include this command at the beginning of the program.

Since it modifies the global status of the calculator, {{ClockOn}} can't be used inside a function. If you're writing a function that depends on measuring time (so you need the clock to be on), the best thing you can do is use the {{[[[68k:isClkOn()]]]}} command to check if the clock is on or off, and return an error message if it's off.
