The {{abs()}} command returns the absolute value of an expression.  The absolute value of a real number is the number of units from 0 the number is.  The absolute value of 7 for example is 7 becasue it is that many units away from zero.  The absolute value of -7 however is 7.  So it in a way gets rid of the negative.

The absolute value of a complex or imaginary number can also be taken, but it is done a little differently.  If a complex number is written a+b//i//, then the absolute value of the number is √(a^^2^^+b^^2^^).
