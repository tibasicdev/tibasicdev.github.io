You can remove closing parentheses, braces, and quotes at the end of a line of code. The one //rare// case you would keep an end parenthesis if if you are dealing with an If conditional directly after a [[[For(]]] loop which is detailed on the For( command.

[[code]]
:Output(3,2,"Hello")
can be
:Output(3,2,"Hello
[[/code]]

You can also remove closing parentheses, braces, brackets, and quotes that are before a store command.

[[code]]
:"Hello"→Str1
can be
:"Hello→Str1
[[/code]]

Rearrange the group of expressions with the most closing parentheses, braces, brackets, and quotes so that they are at the end of the line.

[[code]]
:If 7/(A+B)=2
can be
:If 2=7/(A+B
[[/code]]

Keep your label and list names as short as possible. You ideally want them to be one character in length.

[[code]]
:Lbl AA
:∟HIGH
can be
:Lbl A
:∟H
[[/code]]

When displaying text, always look for words that can be replaced with the respective command. The commands are much smaller than writing out the word.  In this example, the command [[[Return]]] is used in place of writing out the word.

[[code]]
:"RETURN→Str1
can be
:"Return→Str1
[[/code]]

You can change all of your text to uppercase. Making your text look nice comes with a price. Lowercase letters are two bytes each instead of one byte like uppercase letters. This can really be costly if your program has a lot of text in it.

[[code]]
:Disp "Hello
can be
:Disp "HELLO
[[/code]]

You can often shorten text by removing or rewording some of it.

[[code]]
:Output(3,2,"Too Low
can be
:Output(3,2,"Higher
[[/code]]
