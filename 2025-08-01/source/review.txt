[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**5**. What is the difference between the iPart( and int( commands?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]The difference between iPart( and int( is subtle, and many people aren't even aware of it, but it exists. Whereas iPart( always truncates its parameters, simply removing the integer part, int( always rounds down. This means that they return the same answers for positive numbers, but int( will return an answer 1 less than iPart( for (non-integer) negative numbers. For example, iPart(-5.32) is -5, while int(-5.32) is -6.

**8**. In a statistics class, the teacher asks the students to generate a list of 100 random numbers. Unfortunately, the exercise doesn't work as intended because 22 students, in a class of 30, get the exact same numbers (using different calculators). What's a likely explanation for this surprising coincidence?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]They all had the rand command seeded to zero.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**9**. How many digits of accuracy does the TI-OS have? How many can it display on the screen?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]It has fourteen digits of accuracy, but only ten will be displayed.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**10**. The Output( command can display text at any place on the screen, but what happens when the text goes past the end of the line?
# Nothing. The text simply does not show up.
# An error is returned.
# The text will wrap around to the next line.
# An ellipsis will be displayed at the end of the line, with the rest of the text not being displayed.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]The text will wrap around to the next line.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**11**. //True// or //False//: You need to use a Pause command before clearing the screen, otherwise the user will only see the text on the screen for a couple seconds; it will be a blur.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]False. There are other options available, including using the rand command for a short delay or using a small Repeat getKey:End loop.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**12**. When is using the Menu( command appropriate, and even desired? (Choose the best answer.)
# If you want a generic menu.
# Your program is going to be text-based.
# It is the most practical menu available in your situation.
# You want your program to stand out, so you need a fancy menu.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]The first three answers are all good, but the best answer is if you want a generic menu.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**13**. What would be the effect of replacing a Disp command with an Output( command and vice verse? Give any instances where this switch might be useful. Also, when would you use Disp in conjunction with Output?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]|The Output( command doesn't scroll the screen when it gets to the bottom, like the Disp command does. The main instance where this is useful is when you have lots of text that you are displaying, and the Output( command will wrap it around to the next line. Output( is also faster than Disp .
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**14**. What is the maximum dimension of a list?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]999. Note, however, that a list that size would barely fit in RAM.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**15**. Which one statement is true about this code?
[[code]]
:Menu("","",B,"",B
:Disp "Test
:Lbl B
:Disp "Pizza
:Output(1,1,"Spaghetti
[[/code]]
# An error will be returned when the Menu command is executed.
# The program will execute, but there will not be any text displayed.
# The "Test" text will be displayed along with the "Pizza" and "Spaghetti" text.
# The "Pizza" and "Spaghetti" text will be displayed, but not the "Test".

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]The "Pizza" and "Spaghetti" text will be displayed, but not the "Test"
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**16**. //True// or //False//: Before using the Menu( command, you need to clear the home screen, otherwise you will have text interrupting the menu.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]False. The Menu( command uses its own screen, which is separate from the home screen.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**17**. Consider the following code:
[[code]]
:0:Menu("Difficulty","Easy",3,"Medium",2,"Hard",1
:Lbl 1:Ans+1
:Lbl 2:Ans+1
:Lbl 3:Ans+1
[[/code]]
The Ans variable keeps track of the last answer, often being used in place of more permanent variables. If the user selects the "Hard" menu item, what will Ans's value be? What effect does the label ordering have on the value, if any? Why?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]Ans's value will be three. The label ordering causes the value of Ans to be incremented by one for each difficulty level.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**18**. //True// or //False//: Using the home screen is faster than using the graph screen?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]False. Both take the same time.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**19**. Which of the following cannot be used to test if a variable is any of 1, 2, 3, or 4?

# If sum(A={1,2,3,4
# If (A=int(A))(A>=1)(A<=4)
# If A={1,2,3,4}
# If A(int(A)=A)(A<5)

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]If A={1,2,3,4} because the If command does not work with lists.  However, #4 would also trigger, for all integers less then 5 except for 0.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]True.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**21**. Name a command or function that cannot be interrupted by pressing the [ON] key.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]

**22**. For which of the following would not(B) not equal 0?

# .01→B
# 0→B
# π→B
# -4→B

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]0→B. Remember that not( negates the value, so 0 becomes 1.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**23**. //True// or //False//: The following is an alternative to using the and operator.

[[code]]
:If Anot(B
[[/code]]

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]False.  Actually, in that code, the not(B is done first, so the only thing that returns true with that is if A is 1, and B is 0.  Not a replacement of and.

**30**. Which of the following variables is it possible to archive?

# Y,,1,,
# prgmKEWLGAME
# the real variable T
# the real variable A
# L_RESID
# L,,1,,

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]prgmKEWLGAME, the real variable A, and L1. Trying to archive Y1T,, and ∟RESID will give you an ERR:VARIABLE error.
[[/code]]

**31**. Without trying it first, is this legal?

[[code]]
:[A]L4([A]([A](L1(1),L2(1)),L1(1(L2(2L3
[[/code]]

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]|No. While the syntax is correct, an error is returned when trying to get the particular element multiplied by the entire L3 list.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**32**. How would you find the fifth element from the last in a sequence of 20 elements?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]

**38**. Which of these are logically equivalent?

# not(P or Q)
# P and Q
# not(P and Q)
# not(P) or not(Q)
# not(P) and not(Q)

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]"not(P or Q)" and "not(P) and not(Q)" are logically equivalent, while "not(P and Q)" and "not(P) or not(Q)" are logically equivalent. This is based off of DeMorgan's Law.

**39**. //True// or //False//: There are actually 256 picture variables on the calculator, even though only 10 picture variables show up.

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]True. Although the other 246 must be accessed through assembly.
[[/code]]
[[/collapsible]]

**40**. What are the differences between Assembly and TI-Basic? When would you use Assembly and when would you use TI-Basic?

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]Unlike TI-Basic, which uses commands and functions that are easy to understand, assembly is programmed in the calculator's own machine language, and thus is much harder to program in and read. You would use assembly when you want your program to be fast, and you would use TI-Basic when you want to program your game fast.

**41**. How long will the program go through the loop until it stops execution?

[[code]]
:0→X
:While X
:Disp "Another Loop
:X+1→X
:If X=25
:Stop
:End
[[/code]]

**Answer:**[[collapsible show="+ show" hide="- hide"]]
[[code]]This is a trick question. The while loop is false, so X never changes and it ends at 0.

:Disp "X is 25
:X+1→X
:Disp "X is now", X
:End
