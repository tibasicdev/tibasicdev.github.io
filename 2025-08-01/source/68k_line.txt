The {{line}} command draws a line between two points. By default, the drawing mode is set to 1, which draws the line normally, so it doesn't have to be included if drawing a regular line.

Line 0, 3, 0, 9

+ Advanced Uses
The drawmode can be set to 0 to draw a "white" line, which will remove the pixels on the path of the line.
[[code]]
Line 0, 3, 0, 9, 0 //removes the line
[[/code]]
You can also invert pixels on the line using -1 as the number argument.
[[code]]
Line 0, 3, 0, 9, -1
