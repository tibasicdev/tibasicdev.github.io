The {{ClrHome}} command clears the home screen -- not the I/O screen where the result of commands like {{[[[68k:Disp]]]}} or {{[[[68k:Output]]]}} is displayed (you'd need {{[[[68k:ClrIO]]]}} for that), but the screen where you run programs and evaluate expressions. This isn't usually something you want a program to clear, so this isn't a very exciting command.

It also has the drawback that the {{ClrHome}} command itself (or the program it's used in) is displayed on the home screen //after// it is cleared, so the end result is not a blank screen but something like what you see in the screenshot to the right.

Finally, {{ClrHome}} cannot be used inside a function, because functions aren't allowed to modify the state of the calculator.
