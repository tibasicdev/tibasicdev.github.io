This command is used to recall (open) a picture you have saved on your calculator. This is normally used in programs, because you can open pictures from the graph when you are not running a program. It is very useful for sprites as well, as it can recall a picture variable on top of a background, without deleting any of the background. In a program, however, you can recall a different picture for a different input, as shown below:

[[code]]
:If a=16
:RclPic 2
:Else
:RclPic 3
[[/code]]
