**IMPORTANT: DO NOT UPGRADE TO TI-OS 5.6. For more information please click [https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/950/_/ti-83-premium-ceti-84-plus-ce-asmc-removal-updates here.]** Asm Programming was completely removed in TI-OS 5.6, and once upgraded, you cannot downgrade.

**NOTICE:** If you have upgraded to TI84+CE OS 5.4, you cannot use any of these programs because TI said so. If you try to run any of them, the calc will throw an "INVALID" error. You need to use {{AsmComp(prgmSOURCE,prgmNEW}} to run assembly programs.

**DOWNGRADE NOTE:** If you have upgraded to 5.6, a [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKs9jmiOLX0 tutorial is located here to downgrade from OS 5.5+.] This will work with any boot code up to 5.3.1.

------

There are all sorts of small assembly programs that you can create simply using the calculator's built-in assembly commands (specifically, [[[asmprgm#toc1 |Asm84CEPrgm]]]) along with the appropriate hexadecimal code. In order to run a program, you need to use the [[[asm-command|Asm(]]] command, where Asm(prgmPROGNAME is the program that contains the hexadecimal code.

As a word of caution, when entering in the hexadecimal, you need to be very careful that you type it in exactly as you see it. If there is a single incorrect character, the calculator might crash and reset your RAM when you turn it on again. We have tested the hexadecimal codes to make sure they work, but it's up to you to enter them in correctly.

These hexcodes only work on the TI-84 Plus CE. See the following pages for [[[hexcodes|monochrome calcs]]] or the [[[84cse:hexcodes|CSE]]].

+ High-Contrast Screen
[[code]]:Asm84CEPrgm211808F874364436216C3601C9[[/code]]
This will inverse the whole screen to high-contrast mode. This will make it easier to look at the screen during the night.

[[code]]
:Asm84CEPrgm
:FD7E08EE02FD7708C9
[[/code]]
When used in a program, it allows you to use [[[Archive]]] and [[[UnArchive]]] on other programs. **warning:** Make sure to switch back to "program mode" when you're done by running the program again.

+ Lowercase
++ Lowercase On
[[code]]Asm84CEPrgm
:FDCB24DEC9[[/code]]

:FD7E24EE08FD7724C9[[/code]]
This will toggle lowercase on or off

+ Fill Screen [**TO DO**]
++ LCD Clear
[[code]]Asm84CEPrgm
:CD101A02C9[[/code]]
Clears the LCD.

++ LCD Clear and redraw Status Bar
[[code]]Asm84CEPrgm
:CD101A02CD3C1A02C9[[/code]]

++ Error
[[code]]Asm84CEPrgm
:CD500F02CD700F02CD900702C9[[/code]]
This code will cause an error to be thrown, based on the value in Ans. The values correspond to the ones found [http://www.brandonw.net/calcstuff/ti84pce.inc here]. Use your browser's search tool to look for "E_Overflow" which is Error 1. If you are using a Windows or Chromebook, pressing Control+F will bring up the search tool. On a Mac, pressing Command+F will bring up the search tool. By default, there is no Goto option unless you add 128 to the values. So for example, for a divide by zero error with a goto option, use 130 as the error code.
