content: "I'll add programs to this thread as I see fit. Feedback, optimization, and high scores to beat are welcomed (I always try to fit some sort of scoring system in most of my games).\n\n---PONG.8Xp---\nNotes: \nThis is a fully featured pong game, complete with multiplayer, a practice mode, and a \"challenge\" mode in which the player must hit the ball against a wall that continues to move closer to the paddle until the player misses the ball, at which point his score will be tallied and recorded.\nControls:\n[7]: Move the left paddle up one pixel\n[1]: Move the left paddle down one pixel\n[9]: Move the right paddle up one pixel\n[3]: Move the right paddle down one pixel\n[CLEAR]: Pause the game, or exit the game if paused\n[ENTER]: Resume the game if paused\nHacks:\n- The \"L\" variable can be changed to alter the length of both paddles divided by two.\nCatches:\n- It's still not as fast as I'd like it to be.\n- The two player mode is still kind of crippled by the fact that only one one key press can be caught by getKey at a time.\n- Ball movement is rather simplistic, and once you hit a trick shot, there's no way to counter that except returning it.\n- You have to mash the number pad to move the paddle because only the arrow keys can be held. I'm not sure if I like it that way or not.\nMy high score:\n71 for Challenge Mode. I'll admit, I haven't tried that hard.\n[[code]]\n0->C\n0->P\nMenu(\"      PONG      \",\"TWO PLAYER\",2,\"PRACTICE\",P,\"CHALLENGE\",C,\"QUIT\",Q)\nLbl C\n1->C\n2->U\nLbl P\n1->P\nLbl 2\n0->V\n0->W\n0->S\n0->T\n4->L\n32->O\n48->N\n0->E\n1->D\n0->Q\nStoreGDB 0\n1->Xmin\n95->Xmax\nFnOff \nAxesOff\nClrDraw\nIf C or P\nThen\nVertical 1\nVertical 2\nEnd\nHorizontal ~10\nHorizontal 10\nFor(I,1,93,92)\nFor(J,~L+32,L+32,1)\nPxl-On(J,I)\nEnd\nEnd\nWhile not(Q)\ngetKey->G\nIf G\nThen\nIf G=72 and Y-L+32!=1\nThen\nY-1->Y\nPxl-On(Y-L+32,1)\nPxl-Off(Y+L+33,1)\nElse\nIf G=92 and Y+L+32!=61\nThen\nY+1->Y\nPxl-On(Y+L+32,1)\nPxl-Off(Y-L+31,1)\nElse\nIf G=45\nThen\nClrHome\nDisp \"GAME PAUSED\"\nDisp \"[ENTER]: RESUME\"\nDisp \"[CLEAR]: QUIT\"\nWhile not(F)\ngetKey->G\nIf G=45\nThen\n1->Q\n1->F\nEnd\nIf G=105\n1->F\nEnd\n0->G\n0->F\nElse\nIf G=74 and T-L+32!=1\nThen\nT-1->T\nPxl-On(T-L+32,93)\nPxl-Off(T+L+33,93)\nElse\nIf G=94 and T+L+32!=61\nThen\nT+1->T\nPxl-On(T+L+32,93)\nPxl-Off(T-L+31,93)\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nN->A\nO->B\nIf N=1 or N=93\nThen\nIf not(C)\nThen\nClrHome\nIf N=1\nV+1->V\nIf N=93\nW+1->W\nDisp \"LEFT SCORE:\"\nOutput(1,13,V)\nDisp \"RIGHT SCORE:\"\nOutput(2,14,W)\nPause \nIf V>9\nThen\nDisp \"LEFT WINS!\"\n1->Q\nEnd\nIf W>9\nThen\nDisp \"RIGHT WINS!\"\n1->Q\nEnd\n32->O\n48->N\n0->E\nElse\nClrHome\nDisp \"YOU LOSE...\"\nDisp \"YOUR SCORE:\"\nOutput(2,13,U)\nIf U>|LPONG(1)\nU->|LPONG(1)\nDisp \"HIGH SCORE:\"\nOutput(3,13,|LPONG(1))\nPause \n1->Q\nEnd\nEnd\nIf pxl-Test(O,N+D)\nThen\nIf C and U>2\nThen\nVertical U-1\nVertical U\nU+1->U\nEnd\n~D->D\nElse\nIf pxl-Test(O+1,N+D)\nThen\n~1->E\nIf N=2 or N=92\nThen\n~D->D\nIf C\nThen\nVertical U-1\nVertical U\nU+1->U\nEnd\nEnd\nEnd\nIf pxl-Test(O-1,N+D)\nThen\n1->E\nIf N=2 or N=92\n~D->D\nEnd\nEnd\nO+E->O\nN+D->N\nPxl-Off(B,A)\nPxl-On(O,N)\nEnd\nLbl Q\nRecallGDB 0\nClrHome\n[[/code]]\n\nMy other games will be added shortly."
