The {{GridLine}} command enables a grid of colored lines on the graph screen (you can disable it with the {{[[[GridOff]]]}} command). How fine or coarse the grid is depends on the {{[[[system-variables#window|Xscl]]]}} and {{[[[system-variables#window|Yscl]]]}} variables. Drawing the grid just involves plotting points all the horizontal and vertical lines that intersect points of the form (A×{{Xscl}}, B×{{Yscl}}) that are in the graphing window. The grid can be colored based on any color variable or value.

+ Advanced Uses

{{GridLine}} can be used to shade the entire screen if {{Yscl}} is small enough that the lines on the grid are one pixel apart:
[[code]]
:ΔY→Yscl
:GridLine RED
[[/code]]

This is one of the shortest ways to shade the screen, although {{[[[Shade(]]]}} can be used for a (usually) even shorter way. However, using {{GridLine}} is also very slow: the fastest way involves the {{[[[Horizontal]]]}} or the {{[[[Vertical]]]}} commands in a {{[[[For(]]]}} loop.

You could also use {{GridLine}} to draw the playing grid for a Dots and Boxes game.
