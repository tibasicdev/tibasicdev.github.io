content: "Could the {{solve()}} line be simplified to {{θ-2X→A}} (which actually needs to be negated for the algorithm to actually work)?\n\nI don't have a calculator that operates TI-Basic anymore, so I transcribed it to C++.  It seems to work for numbers greater than 50, but for numbers less than 50, it estimates low (ie. 0 outputs -50.5).  I assumed that {{abs(A>100}} was actually {{100<abs(a}}.\n\nI can get it to work by changing:\n[[div class=\"werecode\"]]\n:If abs(A>100\n:100(A>0)→A\n[[/div]]\nto\n[[div class=\"werecode\"]]\n:If A>[[size 80%]]E[[/size]]2\n:[[size 80%]]E[[/size]]2→A\n:If A<0\n:DelVar A\n[[/div]]"
