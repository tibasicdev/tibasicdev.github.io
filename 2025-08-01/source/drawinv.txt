The {{DrawInv}} command draws the inverse of a curve in terms of X. Its single argument is an expression in terms of X.

For example, {{DrawInv X²}} will draw the inverse of the equation Y=X^^2^^. The inverse reverses the variables X and Y, so that the curve X=Y^^2^^ will be graphed. In this case, the inverse of the function has a simple form: Y=√(X) and Y=-√(X); most functions, however, do not have an inverse expressible as Y= equation, making this command particularly useful.

You can also think of this as graphing the expression but with X representing the vertical direction, and Y representing the horizontal.

{{DrawInv}} requires the calculator to be in {{[[[Func]]]}} mode, and is affected by the {{[[[Connected]]]}}/{{[[[Dot]]]}} setting.

+ Advanced Uses

{{DrawInv}} will update X and Y for each coordinate drawn (like {{[[[Tangent(]]]}} and {{[[[DrawF]]]}}), and exit with the last coordinate still stored.

When evaluating the expression using {{DrawInv}}, the calculator will ignore the following errors: [[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]], [[[errors#divideby0|ERR:DIVIDE BY 0]]], [[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]], [[[errors#increment|ERR:INCREMENT]]], [[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]], [[[errors#overflow|ERR:OVERFLOW]]], and [[[errors#singularmat|ERR:SINGULAR MAT]]]. If one of these errors occurs, the data point will be omitted.

For this reason, {{DrawInv}} can sometimes behave in an unexpected fashion: for example, it doesn't throw an error for list or matrix expressions (it won't graph anything, either).

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#mode|ERR:MODE]]]** is thrown if the calculator is not in {{[[[Func]]]}} mode when using {{DrawInv}}.
