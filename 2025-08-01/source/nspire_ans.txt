This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular command. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new command, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the command content. 

If a section (such as Advanced Uses) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

Make the |picture parameter the page name followed by .png and it will find the screenshot file, which is uploaded on the command index page, or will be shortly.


See [[[inc:nspire-command-help|inc:nspire-command-help]]] for a description of the command sidebar template.

The {{Ans}} variable holds the last answer that was stored in the calculator. Because {{Ans}} is stored in a special storage area built-in to the calculator, and it is extensively used by the calculator, you cannot delete it. Ans is also useful; it can make your programs both smaller and faster:

* Unlike other variables which have a value type hard-coded in (i.e., a [[[strings|string]]] can only hold text, and [[[lists]]] and [[[matrices]]] can only hold numbers), {{Ans}} can take on whatever value you want: a real or complex, list, matrix, or string are all acceptable.
* Along with the [[[system-variables#finance|finance]]] variables, {{Ans}} is faster than the real, complex, list, matrix, and string variables; and subsequently, you should try to use it as much as possible.

One of the most common places to use {{Ans}} is in place of storing a value to a variable. Just paste the {{Ans}} variable to the location where the variable was called, and then when the expression is evaluated, the calculator will use the current value of {{Ans}}. Using the {{Ans}} variable allows you to eliminate the variable, which helps save a little or a lot of memory (depending on the type of variable and its size).

The one major drawback to using {{Ans}} is that its current value is only temporary. Whenever you [[[store]]] a value to a variable or place an expression or string on a line by itself, {{Ans}} is updated to the new value. This restriction essentially limits your use of {{Ans}} to only a single variable. If you are manipulating two or more variables, it's best to just use the variables.

There are several cases in which changing the value of a variable does not modify {{Ans}}, thus preserving its current value for later use: 
* storing to an [[[system-variables#equation|equation variable]]] 
* using the {{[[[nspire:DelVar]]]}} command to delete a variable (i.e., set its value to zero, if it's a real variable)
* initializing or changing the value in a {{[[[nspire:For(]]]}} loop.
These cases can be very useful, allowing you to use Ans to store an expression rather than create a temporary variable for it.
