{{StorePic}} saves the graph screen to a picture (to recall it later, use {{RecallPic}}). Every detail of the graph screen will be stored as it appears, with the sole exception of X and Y labels on the axes (if they are shown).

The number passed to {{StorePic}} must be one of 0 through 9. It has to be a number: {{StorePic X}} will not work, even if X contains a value 0 through 9.

+ Advanced Uses

A combination of {{StorePic}} and {{RecallPic}} can be used to maintain a background over which another [[[glossary#s|sprite]]] moves:

First, draw the background, and save it to a picture file with {{StorePic}}.
Next, draw the sprite to the screen.
When you want to move the sprite, erase it, then use {{RecallPic}} to draw the background again.
Then draw the sprite to its new location on the screen again (this can be done before or after using {{RecallPic}}).

Also, if a screen in your program takes more than a second to draw, and is displayed several times, you might want to consider storing it to a picture the first time it's drawn, and then recalling it every next time you want to draw it.

+ Error Conditions
