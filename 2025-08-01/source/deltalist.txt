{{ΔList(}} calculates the differences between consecutive terms of a list, and returns them in a new list.

[[code]]
ΔList({0,1,4,9,16,25,36})
	{1 3 5 7 9 11}
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

The ΔList( command is very nearly the inverse of the [[[cumSum(]]] command, which calculates the cumulative sums of a list. For any list, {{ΔList(cumSum(//list//))}} will return the same list, but without its first element:
[[code]]
ΔList(cumSum({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}))
    {2 3 4 5 6 7}
[[/code]]

Removing the first element would otherwise be a difficult procedure involving the [[[seq-list|seq(]]] command, so this is a useful trick to know.

If a list is sorted in ascending order, {{min(ΔList(//list//))}} will return 0 (false) if there are repeating values in the list, and a value corresponding to true if they are all distinct. The number of repeating elements can be determined similarly via {{1+sum(0≠ΔList(//list//))}} (again, so long as the list is sorted).

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invaliddim|ERR:INVALID DIM]]]** is thrown if {{ΔList(}} is run on a single element list.
