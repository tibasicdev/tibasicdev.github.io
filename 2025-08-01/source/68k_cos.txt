The {{cos()}} command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cosine.html cosine] of an angle measure. Naturally, the result depends on the angle [[[68k:setmode|mode]]] the calculator is in: radian, degree, or (in AMS version 3.10) gradian. You can also use one of the ^^{{[[[68k:radian|r]]]}}^^, {{[[[68k:degree|°]]]}}, ^^{{[[[68k:gradian|G]]]}}^^ marks to specify an angle mode.

For many common angles, {{cos()}} can compute an exact result. Other angles, the calculator will leave alone unless it's in approximate mode (or unless you make it approximate), and then it will give a decimal approximation. As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{cos()}} can be used with complex numbers as well.

[[code]]
:cos(60°)
           1/2
:cos(x+2π)
          cos(x)
:cos(πi/2)
          cosh(π/2)
[[/code]]

If {{cos()}} is applied to a list, it will take the cosine of every element in the list.

+ Advanced Uses

The {{cos()}} of a matrix is not (in general) the same as taking the cosine of every element of the matrix. A different definition is used to compute the result; see [[[68k:matrices#toc2|]]]. It requires the matrix to be square and diagonalizable in order to apply.
