When contributing programs, please follow these guidelines:

# A program should be self-contained, and relatively short in length.
# A program should be thoroughly tested to make sure it works correctly.
# Use the [[[template:routine|Routine Template]]] as the starting point for program pages.
# When the program page is finished, link to it from here.
