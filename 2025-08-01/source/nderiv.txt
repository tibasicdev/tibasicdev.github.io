{{nDeriv(f(var),var,value[,h])}} computes an approximation to the value of the derivative of //f//(//var//) with respect to //var// at //var//=//value//. //h// is the step size used in the approximation of the derivative. The default value of //h// is 0.001.

{{nDeriv(}} only works for real numbers and expressions. {{nDeriv(}} can be used only once inside another instance of {{nDeriv(}}.

+ Advanced

If the default setting for //h// doesn't produce a good enough result, it can be difficult to choose a correct substitute. Although larger values of //h// naturally produce a larger margin of error, it's not always helpful to make //h// very small. If the difference between //f(x+h)// and //f(x-h)// is much smaller than the actual values of //f(x+h)// or //f(x-h)//, then it will only be recorded in the last few significant digits, and therefore be imprecise.

A suitable compromise is to choose a tolerance //h// that's based on X. As suggested [http://www.unitedti.org/index.php?act=ST&f=54&t=4367&hl=&view=findpost&p=68526 here], {{(abs(X)+]E⁻6)E⁻6}} is a reasonably good value that often gives better results than the default. 


+ Formula

The exact formula that the calculator uses to evaluate this function is:

[[math]]
\operatorname{nDeriv}(f(t),t,x,h)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}
[[/math]]


This formula is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_derivative symmetric derivative], and using it generally increases the accuracy of the calculation. However, in a few instances it can give erroneous answers. One case where it gives false answers is with the function, 

[[math]]
f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2} \bigg\vert_{x=0}
[[/math]]

This derivative is undefined when calculated algebraically, but due to the method of calculation, the derivative given by {{nDeriv(}} is zero. These problems can be avoided by ensuring that a function's derivative is defined at the point of interest.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if //h// is 0 (since this would yield division by 0 in the formula)
* **[[[errors#illegalnest|ERR:ILLEGAL NEST]]]** is thrown if {{nDeriv(}} commands are nested more than one level deep. Just having one {{nDeriv(}} command inside another is okay, though.
