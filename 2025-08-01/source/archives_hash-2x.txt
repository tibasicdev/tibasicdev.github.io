|description=This is a multivariable hash function that I created. Its pretty fast (especially on a computer), and can have outputs of any size greater than 8 (any less is ridiculously insecure, although a simple edit to the program will allow for any output size greater than 0). However, due to the limitations of the 83/84, 256 is the max inputs and outputs for the moment. The outputs are stored in Str1, so they can be recalled.

There has been no editing of anything except for the files included in this download.

PS. Any help in analyzing this algorithm is most welcome and greatly appreciated.

|DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE

INSTRUCTIONS

1) First enter the name of your program as you would like it to appear. That is, the TITLE of your program, not the name of the file.
i.e. "Happy Land" instead of "HAPPY.8XP"

2) Enter the name of the Author. You may like to include a link to the author's page, in which case, you must type in this (including the square brackets): [URL AUTHOR]
i.e. [http://www.bobs-site.com Bob Martin]

3) Enter the size of the program (the actual program, or total size of programs & sub-programs) but not the size of the .ZIP file.
i.e. 6,000 bytes

4) Enter the description of the program.

5) Click the "save" button beneath this form.

6) After that, your program page will appear. It will give you two links requesting you to click them to add your files.

BE PATIENT! One of the moderators or administrators will need to manually update your program page to include the files you have added.

This means that when you add files, they don't magically appear. They need to be manually integrated into each page by an administrator or moderator.
