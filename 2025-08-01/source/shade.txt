The Shade( command draws two functions and shades the area between them.

Shade(//lower func//, //upper func//, @@[@@//xmin//, //xmax//, //pattern #//, //resolution//])

* //lowerfunc// and //upperfunc// are the two functions (whenever //lowerfunc//<//upperfunc//, the area between them will be shaded)
* //xmin// and //xmax// (optional) are left and right boundaries on where to shade.
* //pattern #// (optional) is an integer 1-4 determining which pattern to use:
 * 1 -- vertical shading (default)
 * 2 -- horizontal shading
 * 3 -- diagonal shading (negative slope)
 * 4 -- diagonal shading (positive slope)
* //resolution// (optional) is an integer 1-8 determining the spacing between shading lines. When it's 1 (default), everything is shaded, when it's 2, one pixel is skipped between lines, and so on - when it's 8, seven pixels are skipped.

Note that if you don't supply the //resolution// argument, it defaults to 1 and everything gets shaded regardless of the pattern.

+ Advanced Uses

Shade(Ymin,Ymax) is the smallest (though not the fastest) way to shade the entire screen.

+ Error Conditions

(this section is new, and might not be present on older pages - also, some commands may not throw non-generic errors)

For the non-generic errors that might occur when using this command (that is, syntax-type errors shouldn't be included). In a format similar to the following:

* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if the two list arguments have different dimensions.
* **[[[errors#reserved|ERR:RESERVED]]]** is thrown if L_RESID is supplied as an argument.
