The getDate() command checks the date that the calculator is set to, and then returns it in a list format. The list will always be in the format {year, month, day}. To change this list to another format, you can use the closely related [[[68k:getDtStr()]]] option, which just returns the date in a string format, not as a list. The [[[68k:setDtFmt()]]] command does not work on this command, but it will change the format that the calculator returns the [[[68k:getDtStr()]]] command as.

For example, if the calculator's date was set to March 14th, 2011, the getDate() command would return the following:
[[code]]
:getDate()
:     {2011 3 14}
[[/code]]
