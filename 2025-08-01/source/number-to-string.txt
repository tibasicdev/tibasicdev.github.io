**Note:** If you have a TI-84+ CE with OS 5.2 or higher, you can ignore this entire routine and just use the {{[[[toString(]]]}} command.

[[code]]
:{0,1→L₁
:NAns→L₂
:LinReg(ax+b) Y₁
:Equ►String(Y₁,Str1
:sub(Str1,1,length(Str1)-3→Str1
[[/code]]

This code works because it creates two points with a known best fit line: the best fit line through (0,0) and (1,N) is y=Nx+0. {{[[[LinReg(ax+b)]]]}} calculates this best fit line, and stores its equation to {{Y₁}}.

Then, we use {{[[[Equ►String(]]]}} to store this equation to {{Str1}}, which now contains "NX+0" with N replaced by the numerical value of N. After that, the [[[sub(]]] command get rids of the "X+0" at the end, leaving only the string representation of N.

This routine uses {{L₁}}, {{L₂}}, and {{Y₁}}, so you should [[[cleanup|clean up]]] those variables at the end of your program. If you're working with the graph screen in [[[graphing-mode#function|function]]] mode, storing to {{Y₁}} can be a problem since it will draw an unwanted line through your graphics. Use {{r₁}} instead but make sure the calculator isn't in [[[graphing-mode#polar|polar]]] mode.

**Note:** This only works for real numbers. With complex numbers, such as imaginary numbers, you can use this code at the end of the first to get the same effect with //i// in it. This routine will also only work for N<10^50. To convert larger N, see the alternate below.

+ Alternate Routine

The following routine will perform the same function for converting N to a string as shown above. This routine, however, allows N to be as large as the TI-84+ overflow limit (10^100) by utilizing {{[[[Med-Med]]]}} regression.

[[code]]
:{0,.5,1→L₁
:NAns→L₂
:Med-Med Y₁
:Equ►String(Y₁,Str1
:sub(Str1,1,length(Str1)-3→Str1
