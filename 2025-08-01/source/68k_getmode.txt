The getMode() command checks any one current mode setting. Just give it the name of the mode setting to check, as a string, and it will give you the current value. For example:

[[code]]
:getMode("Angle")
           "RADIAN"
:getMode("Complex Format")
           "REAL"
[[/code]]

The name of the setting is not case-sensitive, but is very typo-sensitive.

In practice, getMode() is almost entirely superseded by [[[68k:setMode()]]] -- usually, you don't care about a setting unless you want to change it if it's wrong. In particular, it is silly to do the following:

[[code]]
:If getMode("Angle")≠"RADIAN"
:  setMode("Angle","RADIAN")
[[/code]]

In this case, just the setMode() command instruction by itself would have been fine, since changing the mode from radian to radian would've done nothing anyway. 

It is //also// silly to do the following:
[[code]]
:getMode("Angle")→oldmode
:setMode("Angle","RADIAN")
...
:setMode("Angle",oldmode)
[[/code]]
It is a noble impulse to try to preserve the old setting and restore it later. However, the same is accomplished more elegantly with (note the { } brackets):
[[code]]
:setMode({"Angle","RADIAN"})→oldmode
...
:setMode(oldmode)
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

Every string like "Angle" or "FLOAT 12" can be replaced by a numerical equivalent (one that is, for some reason, still given as a string, e.g. "3" or "26"). Using these is shorter, and it has the benefit of being international. 

See the [[[68k:mode-settings|Table of Mode Settings]]] to look up these numbers, as well as read about what the various mode settings do.
