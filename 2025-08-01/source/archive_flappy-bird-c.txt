description: "Full-screen Flappy Bird emulation on the TI-84+ CSE and CE calculators.\n\n\"This is a remake of the previously uploaded game Flappy Bird which features a more intuitive design which allows users to change the speed, and makes the input easier. The code was completely rewritten, and has been tested. It now appears to be bug-free.\n\nTo change the speed, change the first line of the program. A lower number stored into D will make the program faster, higher numbers will make it slower. D must be at least 1.\" - Taken from Trenly's Flappy Bird 2 description.\n\nIf your calculator is older than a TI-84+ CSE, then you need to use Trenly's [[[archive:flappy-bird-2|Flappy Bird 2]]]."
