∫(//expression//,//variable//) takes the integral of //expression// (symbolically) with respect to //variable//. All other variables are treated as constant.

There are three ways to use ∫(). The syntax above returns an indefinite integral. ∫(//expression//,//variable//,//c//) does the same, but with a constant of integration, //c// (this will just get added on to the result). Finally, ∫(//expression//,//variable//,//a//,//b//) takes a definite integral from //a// to //b//. These limits can be anything, including undefined variables, ∞ and -∞, as long as they don't depend on //variable//.

:∫(x^2,x,a,b)

Indefinite integrals are always computed exactly or not at all: if a part of the expression (or the entire expression) can't be integrated, the result will stay in terms of ∫(). However, definite integrals will sometimes be approximated, depending on the Exact/Approx [[[68k:mode-settings|mode setting]]]:
* If EXACT, integrals will never be approximated.
* If AUTO, the calculator will approximate integrals like ∫(//e//^(-x^2),x,-1,1) that it can't compute exactly.
* If APPROX, all definite integrals will be done numerically if possible.

:∫(e^(-x^2),x)
           ∫(e^(-x^2),x)
:∫(e^(-x^2),x,-1,1)
           2*∫(e^(-x^2),x,0,1) (in EXACT mode)
           1.49365 (in AUTO or APPROX mode)

Finally, you can take multiple integrals by applying ∫() to the result of another ∫() (any number of times). The integration limits of the inner integrals can involve the variables of the outer integrals.

[[code]]
:∫(∫(x*y,x),y)
           y^2*x^2/4
:∫(∫(x*y,x,0,y),y,0,1)
           1/8

If the expression is a list or matrix, ∫() takes the integral of each element.
