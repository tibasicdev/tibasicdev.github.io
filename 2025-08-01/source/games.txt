The programs linked from this page are complete (if simple) games, presented with source code and an explanation. They are meant as a way of putting everything that is on this guide together into an example of what TI-Basic programmers like you can do. For readers who learn better by example than by explanation, these games are also a great way to learn the techniques explained in this guide.
