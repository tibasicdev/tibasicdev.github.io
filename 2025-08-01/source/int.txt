{{int(X)}} is the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FloorFunction.html floor function]. It returns the greatest integer less than or equal to //X//, and also works on complex numbers, lists and matrices.

[[code]]
int(5.32)
               5
int(4/5)
               0
int(‾5.32)
               ‾6
int(‾4/5)
               ‾1

The difference between {{[[[iPart(]]]}} and {{int(}} is subtle, and many people aren't even aware of it, but it exists. Whereas {{iPart(}} always truncates its parameters, simply removing the fractional part, {{int(}} always rounds down. This means that they return the same answers for positive numbers, but {{int(}} will return an answer 1 less than {{iPart(}} for (non-integer) negative numbers. For example, {{iPart(-5.32)}} is -5, while {{int(-5.32)}} is -6.

Most of the time, however, you're dealing with only positive numbers anyway. In this case, the decision to use {{iPart(}} or {{int(}} is mostly a matter of preference - some people use {{int(}} because it is shorter; some use {{iPart(}} when there is a corresponding {{[[[fPart(]]]}} taken. However, if speed is a consideration, one should check the Command Timings section.

+ Advanced Uses

{{int(}}, along with {{[[[iPart(]]]}} and {{[[[fPart(]]]}}, can be used for integer [[[compression]]].

+ Command Timings

The following table compares the speeds of {{int(}} and {{iPart(}}. Each command was timed over 2000 iterations to find a noticeable difference.

||~ Format ||~ Bars ||~ Pixels ||~ Total ||
|| iPart(1 || 10 || 1 || 81 ||
|| iPart(1.643759 || 10 || 1 || 81 ||
|| int(1 || 8 || 7 || 71 ||
|| int(1.643759 || 10 || 2 || 82 ||

Conclusion: {{int(}} scales with the length of its input while {{iPart(}} does not. For fewer than 6 decimals, {{int(}} will most often be faster; for 6 or more decimals, consider using {{iPart(}}.
