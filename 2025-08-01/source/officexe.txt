Office XE is a full-featured office package that includes a text editor, presentation/slide show maker, and a graphics program. Each program has a similar interface so if you can use one you can use them all. All of these programs are very advanced and include features never seen before in basic programs.

* **Document XE** -- A fast, advanced text editor with an easy to use interface.
* **Presentation XE** -- An easy-to-use slideshow maker with a simple way to organize pictures and create a presentation.
* **Draw XE** -- A very sophisticated drawing program, with all drawing done on the fly and and several different drawing tools and options available.
