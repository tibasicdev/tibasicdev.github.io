This command displays several picture variables in a cycle, with each picture getting an optional wait time, number of cycles, and the direction to display the pictures in. For instance, if you have saved 5 pictures: pic1, pic2, pic3, pic4, pic5, then you could do this to display them all: {{CyclePic}} "pic", 5, 3, 2, -1. This would display all 5 pictures for 3 seconds each, for 2 cycles, and backward, meaning it would display picture 5 first. Unfortunately, there is no way to use the command on pictures that are stored in a folder. For instance, if you had the previous case, but every picture is stored in a folder called PICTURES, there is no way to cycle them without moving them out of the folder.

[[code]]
:CyclePic "ham", 3, 1.5, 6, 1
[[/code]]

The above code would display pictures "ham1", "ham2", and "ham3" in that order for 1.5 seconds each, and for 6 cycles.

+ Advanced Uses

This command can be used to create a slideshow-style program, or it can be used to display a sprite so it looks like it is moving. Note that you cannot use this function if the pictures are not in the MAIN file folder.
