…that it is actually sometimes better to leave on the closing parentheses on the [[[For(]]] loop?

…that a memory leak is caused when you use a [[[goto|Goto/Lbl]]] within a [[[while|loop]]] or [[[If]]] conditional (anything that has an [[[End]]] command) to jump out of that control structure before the End command is reached?

…that you can omit the closing parentheses, quote, square bracket, curly brace, etc. at the end of a command or function?

{$part3begin}

…that while using [[[seq-list|seq(]]], the calculator can still interpret keypresses and store them to [[[getKey]]]?

…that you can use [[[tanh]]](,,E,,9X to compute the sign of X?

…that [[[Line(]]] has an optional fifth argument that, if zero, will //erase// the pixels on a line?

…that you can remove the "Done" message that appears after a program is finished running by placing an expression, some text, or just a quote on the last line of your program?

…that you can use [[[rand]]](# to create a time delay?

…that you can use multiple //text// arguments at the end of one Text( command to write, for example, Text(R,C,"Score",S)?

…that you can draw with different plot marks using [[[Pt-On]]](X,Y,#)?

…that you can save memory when displaying text by replacing words such as "If" and "Time" with the appropriate commands?

…that "0<X<10" will actually compare "0<X" first, and compares the result (0 or 1) to 10, so "0<X and X<10" should be used instead?

…that using [[[deltalist|ΔList(]]] together with [[[cumSum(]]] will return a list with its first element removed?

…that there are 256 [[[pictures|picture variables]]] built-in to the TI-83+ calculator, even though the calculator only shows 10 picture variables?

…that you can enable the faster circle drawing flag on the TI-83+ by placing a list with an imaginary //[[[i]]]// after the last argument of the [[[Circle(]]] command?

…that you can get the [[[homescreen|home screen]]] font on the [[[graphscreen|graph screen]]] (except on the regular TI-83) by placing a '-1' at the beginning of the [[[Text(]]] command?

…that you can get the number of digits in a whole number by using the formula 1+int(log(#?

…that the smallest way to implement the distance formula is by using the [[[R►Pr(]]] command?

…that you can use the [[[percent|%]]] symbol or [[[sub|sub(]]] with one argument as a smaller replacement for multiplying by .01?

…that you can get rid of the run indicator by using Text(-1,0,90," ") on the graph screen and Output(1,16," ") on the home screen?

…that you can run your TI-Basic program from an [[[asmshells|assembly shell]]] by placing a colon (":") as the first line of your program?

…that you can store to the [[[lists|list]]] element one past the last element to add it to the end?

…that it is actually sometimes better to leave on the closing parentheses on the [[[For(]]] loop?

…that the [[[system-variables#finance|finance variables]]] are the fastest variables to use, even faster than [[[Ans]]]?

…that the [[[String►Equ(]]] command is completely useless, and you can store a string into one of the [[[system-variables#equation|equation variables]]] just using the → ([[[store]]]) operator?

…that the fastest way to check for a whole number is not([[[fPart(]]]?

…that you can [[[compression|compress]]] a list of related numbers by combining them into integer and fraction parts?

…that the majority of the [[[graphscreen|graphics]]] commands are dependent upon the [[[system-variables#window|window dimensions]]], so you should always use a [[[friendly-window|friendly graphing window]]] to ensure everything shows up as you intended?

…that you can make [[[subprograms]]] that are contained inside the program itself, so that they can be called by the program whenever needed?

…that you can use [[[SetUpEditor]]] to UnArchive a list, but at the same time create it if it doesn't exist?

…that you can get away with not having a colon or a new line after [[[DelVar]]]?

…that placing a [[[Lbl]]] after [[[DelVar]]] will make that Lbl literally disappear?

…that you can scroll the [[[Pause]]] command's optional argument to see it in its entirety?

…that the smallest (though not the fastest) way to shade the entire [[[graphscreen|graph screen]]] is Shade(Ymin,Ymax)?

…that pressing alpha in the program editor followed by up or down, you will scroll a whole page of program code?

…that pressing 2nd right in the program editor will take you to the end of your current line, and 2nd left will take you to the beginning of that line?

…that TI added several new TI-Basic commands to the newer TI-84+/SE calculators?

…that any math calculations that involve extremely small or large numbers (ranging from -,,E,,99 to ,,E,,99) will produce rounding errors that don't return the right number?

…that a memory leak is caused when you use a [[[goto|Goto/Lbl]]] within a [[[while|loop]]] or [[[If]]] conditional (anything that has an [[[End]]] command) to jump out of that control structure before the End command is reached?

…that a [[[Repeat]]] loop will always loop at least once, regardless of if the condition is true or false before entering the loop?

…that the arrow and DEL keys can actually be held down, which will cause the key to keep being repeated until it is unpressed?

…that the [[[key codes]]] follow a simple pattern: a key is represented by putting its row and column together?

…that you can access the lowercase letters by using an [[[assembly]]] program to turn on the lowercase flag that the calculator uses for enabling lowercase letters?

…that the [[[Horiz]]] will split the screen in half horizontally, with both the graph screen and home screen being shown at the same time?

…that the [[[expr(]]] command allows you to store an expression to a [[[strings|string]]] and then execute the string?

…that the TI-83 series of calculators does implicit [[[multiply|multiplication]]], so there is no need to ever use the * sign?

…that [[[iPart(]]] and [[[int(]]] will return the same answers for positive numbers, but int( will return an answer 1 less than iPart( for (non-integer) negative numbers?

…that [[[lists]]] are the only variable that you can give your own names to?

…that you can omit the closing parentheses, quote, square bracket, curly brace, etc. at the end of a command or function?

…that [[[Finance]]] under the Applications menu is really not an application at all?
