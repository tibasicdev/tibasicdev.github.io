The {{ZTrig}} command sets the screen to a special [[[friendly window]]] useful for trigonometric calculations. Unlike the {{[[[ZDecimal]]]}} and {{[[[ZInteger]]]}} commands, for which the distance between two pixels is a short decimal or integer, {{ZTrig}} sets the horizontal distance between two pixels to be π/24 (in {{[[[radian-mode|Radian]]]}} mode) or 7.5 (in {{[[[degree-mode|Degree]]]}} mode) . The specific changes {{ZTrig}} makes are:
* Xmin=-352.5[[[degree-symbol|°]]] or -47/24π^^[[[radian-symbol|r]]]^^
* Xmax=352.5° or 47/24π^^r^^
* Xscl=90° or π/2^^r^^
* Ymin=-4
* Ymax=4
* Yscl=1

Although this window is not quite square (and therefore, distances in the X and Y direction are not exactly equally proportioned), it is quite close, when in {{Radian}} mode. In a square window (such as the output of {{[[[ZSquare]]]}}), Ymax would have to be 31/24π, which is approximately 4.05789. As you can see, the value of 4 that {{ZTrig}} uses is not too far off.

+ Advanced Uses

In theory, {{ZTrig}} should be quite useful in graphing trigonometric functions, since the calculated points would fall exactly on important angles; for example, it would graph the asymptotes of Y={{[[[tan(]]]}}X) correctly. This is actually only true when in {{[[[degree-mode|Degree]]]}} mode. In {{[[[radian-mode|Radian]]]}} mode, due to round-off error, the pixels far away from the origin do not //exactly// correspond to rational multiples of π. For example, the pixel which was supposed to correspond to π/2 actually has a value of .5000000001*π, which is enough to make this command mostly useless.

However, in {{[[[G-T]]]}} mode, the size that the graph takes up on the screen is different, and {{ZTrig}} uses the same values, unlike {{[[[ZDecimal]]]}}.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** occurs if this command is used outside a program (but not if the menu option is used, of course).
