The π constant on the calculator approximates the mathematical constant [*http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pi.html π] (pi), defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It's fairly important in many areas of mathematics, but especially trigonometry. Probably the most common use of π on the TI-83 series calculators is for dealing with angles in [[[radian-mode|radian]]] form.

The approximate value of π stored on the calculator is 3.1415926535898.
