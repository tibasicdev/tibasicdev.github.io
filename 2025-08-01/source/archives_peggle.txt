|description=Peggle is a fun and addicting physics based game.  The game consists of 9 levels composed of several different types of blocks.  You are given 9 balls to shoot into the arena to try to hit as many blocks as possible, resulting in them being erased at the end of a turn.  If all blocks are erased, you proceed to the next level.  Sophisticated scoring also allows for highscores to be made even if a level is not beaten.  You can choose to play as one of 4 characters, each character having there own powerup accessible by hitting a special block. With challenging gameplay, stunning graphics, and great replayability, Peggle is a must for all calculator gamers!
