when lists are used as arguments, a list is returned that is list2 appended to list1. When matrices are used, if a comma is used to separate arguments, the matrices must have equal row dimensions and matrix2 is appended to matrix1 as new columns. If a semicolon is used, the matrices must have equal column dimension and matrix2 is appended to matrix1 as new rows.

augment({1,⁻3,2},{5,4})
          {1,⁻3,2,5,4}
:[1,2:3,4]→M1
          [1,2:3,4]
:[5,6]→M2
          [5,6]
:augment(M1,M2)
          [1,2,5:3,4,6]
:[5,6]→M2
          [5,6]
:augment(M1;M2)
          [1,2:3,4:5,6]
