The rand() command generates a random number. It can be used in one of two ways:
* rand() gives a random real number between 0 and 1.
* rand(//n//) gives a random integer between 1 and //n//.

By adding or multiplying appropriately, you can change these bounds. For example, 10rand() gives a random real number between 0 and 10, and rand(9)-5 gives a random number between -4 and 4.

+ Advanced Uses

Using the [[[68k:RandSeed]]] command makes the random numbers entirely predictable: after setting the random seed to some value, the same random numbers will be returned every time.

+ Error Conditions
