+ TI-Nspire

[[f<image tinspire.png]]

The standard TI-Nspire calculator is comparable to the TI-84 Plus in features and functionality. It features a TI-84 mode by way of a replaceable snap-in keypad (included) and contains a TI-84 Plus emulator. The likely target of this is secondary schools that make use of the TI-84 Plus currently or have textbooks that cover the TI-83 (Plus) and TI-84 Plus lines, and to allow them to transition to the TI-Nspire line more easily.

+ TI Nspire CX

[[f<image TI-nspire_CX size="small"]]

The TI-Nspire CX is one of the latest updates to the TI-Nspire series. It has a thinner design with a thickness of 1.57 cm (almost half of the TI-89), a 1200 mAh rechargeable battery (wall adapter is included in the American retail package), a 320 by 240 pixel full color backlit display (3.2" diagonal), and OS 3.0 which includes features such as 3D graphing. With the exception of interchangeable TI-84 keypads, the CX series retain all features of the previous TI-Nspire models. The colors of the calculator are still the same as those of the TI-Nspire models; the CX is white and dark blue. In addition, the external connectors have changed slightly. The mini-USB port, located at the center of the top of the TI-Nspire series, has moved to the right on the CX series. Lastly, on the CX series, TI added a second port immediately left of the mini-USB port, for a new wireless module.

+ TI Nspire CAS

[[f<image 220px-TI-Nspire_CAS_Touchpad.JPG size="small"]]

The TI-Nspire CAS calculator is capable of displaying and evaluating values symbolically, not just as floating-point numbers. It includes algebraic functions such as a symbolic differential equation solver: deSolve(...), the complex eigenvectors of a matrix: eigVc(...), as well as calculus based functions, including limits, derivatives, and integrals. For this reason, the TI-Nspire CAS is more comparable to the TI-89 Titanium and Voyage 200 than to other calculators. Its likely targets are college students and universities. Unlike the TI-Nspire, it is not compatible with the snap-in TI-84 Plus keypad.
