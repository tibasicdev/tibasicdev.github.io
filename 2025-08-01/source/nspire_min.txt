This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular command. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new command, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the command content. 

If a section (such as Advanced Uses) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

Make the |picture parameter the page name followed by .png and it will find the screenshot file, which is uploaded on the command index page, or will be shortly.


See [[[inc:nspire-command-help|inc:nspire-command-help]]] for a description of the command sidebar template.

min(//x//,//y//) returns the smallest of the two numbers //x// and //y//. min(//list//) returns the smallest element of //list//. min(//list1//,//list2//) returns the pairwise minima of the two lists. min(//list1//,//x//) (equivalently, min(//x//,//list1//)) returns a list whose elements are the smaller of //x// or the corresponding element of the original list.

[[code]]
min(2,3)
     2
min({2,3,4})
     2
min({1,3},{4,2})
     {1 2}
min({1,3},2)
     {1 2}
[[/code]]

Unlike [[[operators#relational|relational operators]]], such as < and >, min( can also compare complex numbers. To do this, both arguments must be complex -- either complex numbers or complex lists: min(2,//i//) will throw a [[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]] error even though min(2+0//i//,//i//) won't. In the case of complex numbers, the number with the smallest absolute value will be returned. When the two numbers have the same absolute value, the second one will be returned: min(//i//,-//i//) returns -//i// and min(-//i//,//i//) returns //i//.

+ Advanced Uses

min( can be used in Boolean comparisons to see if every value of a list is 1 (true) -- useful because commands like [[[nspire:If]]] or [[[nspire:While]]] only deal with numbers, and not [[[lists]]], but comparisons like L1=L2 return a list of values. In general, the behavior you want varies, and you will use the min( or [[[nspire:max(]]] functions accordingly.

Using min( will give you a strict test -- only if every single value of a list is true will min( return true. For example, the following code will test if two lists are identical -- they have the same exact elements -- and print EQUAL in that case:
[[code]]
If dim(L1)=dim(L2
Then
If min(L1=L2
Disp "EQUAL
End
[[/code]]

The first check, to see if the sizes are identical, is necessary because otherwise comparing the lists will return a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown when comparing a real and a complex number. This can be avoided by adding 0//i// to the real number.
* **[[[nspire:errors#240|Dimension Mismatch]]]** is thrown, when using min( with two lists, if they have different dimensions.
