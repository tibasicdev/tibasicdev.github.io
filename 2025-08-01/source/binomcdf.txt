This command is used to calculate the binomial cumulative probability function. In plainer language, it solves a specific type of often-encountered probability problem, that occurs under the following conditions:
# A specific event has only two outcomes, which we will call "success" and "failure"
# This event is going to repeat a specific number of times, or "trials"
# Success or failure is determined randomly with the same probability of success each time the event occurs
# We're interested in the probability that there are **at most** N successes

For example, consider a couple that intends to have 4 children. What is the probability that at most 2 are girls?

# The event here is a child being born. It has two outcomes "boy" or "girl". In this case, since the question is about girls, it's easier to call "girl" a success.
# The event is going to repeat 4 times, so we have 4 trials
# The probability of a girl being born is 50% or 1/2 each time
# We're interested in the probability that there are at most 2 successes (2 girls)

The syntax here is {{binomcdf(//trials//, //probability//, //value//)}}. In this case:
[[code]]
:binomcdf(4,.5,2
[[/code]]
This will give .6875 when you run it, so there's a .6875 probability out of 4 children, at most 2 will be girls.

An alternate syntax for {{binomcdf(}} leaves off the last argument, //value//. This tells the calculator to compute a list of the results for all values. For example:
[[code]]
:binomcdf(4,.5
[[/code]]

This will come to {.0625 .3125 .6875 .9375 1} when you run it. These are all the probabilities we get when you replace "at most 2 girls" with "at most 0", "at most 1", etc. Here, .0625 is the probability of "at most 0" girls (or just 0 girls), .3125 is the probability of at most 1 girl (1 or 0 girls), etc.

Several other probability problems actually are the same as this one. For example, "less than N" girls, just means "at most N-1" girls. "At least N" girls means "at most (total-N)" boys (here we switch our definition of what a success is). "No more than", of course, means the same as "at most".

+ Advanced (for programmers)

The {{[[[binompdf(]]]}} and {{binomcdf(}} commands are the only ones apart from {{[[[seq-list|seq(]]]}} that can return a list of a given length, and they do it much more quickly. It therefore makes sense, in some situations, to use these commands as substitutes for {{[[[seq-list|seq(]]]}}. 

Here's how to do it:

# {{cumSum(}}{{binomcdf(}}N,0 gives the list {1 2 ... N+1}, and {{cumSum(}}{{not(}}{{binompdf(}}N,0 gives the list {0 1 2 ... N}.
# With {{seq(}}, you normally do math inside the list: {{seq(}}3I^^2^^,I,0,5
# With these commands, you do the same math outside the list: 3{{Ans}}^^2^^ where {{Ans}} is the list {0 1 ... 5}.

[[code]]
:seq(2^I,I,1,5
can be
:cumSum(binomcdf(4,0
:2^Ans
which in turn can be
:2^cumSum(binomcdf(4,0
[[/code]]

In general (where f() is some operation or even several operations):

[[code]]
:seq(f(I),I,1,N
can be
:cumSum(binomcdf(N-1,0
:f(Ans
which can sometimes be
:f(cumSum(binomcdf(N-1,0
[[/code]]

If the lower bound on I in the {{seq(}} statement is 0 and not 1, you can use {{binompdf(}} instead:

[[code]]
:seq(f(I),I,0,N
can be
:cumSum(not(binompdf(N,0
:f(Ans
which can sometimes be
:f(cumSum(not(binompdf(N,0
[[/code]]

This will not work if some command inside {{seq(}} can take only a number and not a list as an argument. For example, seq(L,,1,,(I),I,1,5 cannot be optimized this way.

+ Formulas

Since "at most N" is equivalent to "0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or ... N", and since we can combine these probabilities by adding them, we can come up with an expression for {{binomcdf(}} by adding up values of {{[[[binompdf(]]]}}:

[[math]]
\operatorname{binomcdf}(n,p,k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}\operatorname{binompdf}(n,p,i) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}\binom{n}{i}\,p^i\,(1-p)^{n-i}
[[/math]]

(If you're not familiar with sigma notation, [[$ \sum_{i=0}^{k}$]] just means "add the following up for each value of i 0 through k")
