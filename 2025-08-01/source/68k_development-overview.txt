The development of a program is essential to its ability to succeed and be good. The development is a cycle that can be repeated as many times as desired, each time making a new version. This cycle will allow you to make your program usable, efficient and clean. Here is a list of the parts of the development cycle:

* [[[68k:planning|Planning]]]
* [[[68k:comments|Commenting Code]]]
* [[[68k:debugging|Debugging]]]
* [[[68k:setup-and-cleanup|Setup and Cleanup]]]
* [[[68k:usability|Usability]]]
* [[[68k:optimization|Optimization]]]
* [[[68k:timings|Code Timings]]]
