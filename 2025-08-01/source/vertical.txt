Vertical //X// draws a vertical line from the top of the graph screen to the bottom at //X//. Vertical is usually only used to replace a line that stretches the entire length of the graph screen, along with its counterpart [[[Horizontal]]].

Vertical is affected by the window settings, unlike the [[[pxl-on|Pxl-]]] commands.
