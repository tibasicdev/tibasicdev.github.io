cFactor(expression1) returns expression1 factored with respect to all of its variables over a common denominator.

expression1 is factored as much as possible toward linear rational factors even if this introduces new non-real numbers. This alternative is appropriate if you want factorization with respect to more than one variable.

When a list or matrix is provided, cFactor() will iterate over the list or matrix.

:cFactor(a^3*x^2+a*x^2+a^3+a)
          a*(a+⁻i)*(a+i)*(x+⁻i)*(x+i)
:cFactor(x^2+4/9)
          (3*x + -2*i)*(3*x + 2*i)
:cFactor(x^2+3)
          x²+3
:cFactor(x^2+a)
          x²+a
