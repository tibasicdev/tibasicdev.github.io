[[include inc:68k-command
|picture=pxloff.png
|summary=Turns off a pixel on the graph screen.
|syntax=PxlOff //row//, //column//
|size=2 bytes
]]

The PxlOff command erases a pixel on the graph screen. It uses pixel coordinates, which means that the result isn't affected by [[[68k:system-variables#window|window variables]]] like xmin and xmax: PxlOff P, Q will always erase the pixel P rows down and Q columns across from the top left corner of the graph screen.

The range of possible values (anything outside this range will give an error) is:
* 0..76 for the row and 0..158 for the column, on a TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium.
* 0..102 for the row and 0..238 for the column, on a TI-92, TI-92 Plus, or Voyage 200.

Note that this doesn't match the output of [[[68k:getConfg()]]] -- the command is reliable for figuring out which of the two situations you're in, but the values it gives for window width/height are incorrect.

When in split screen mode, PxlOff still won't give an error as long as the values are in the regular range, but erasing a pixel off the screen will have no effect. The output of getConfg() will reflect the change in window size, but the values themselves still won't be correct.

+ Advanced Uses

PxlOff can also be used with two lists of the same size. In that case, it will erase the pixels for every pair of elements (rowlist[n], collist[n]). This is a rarely-used alternative to a command like [[[68k:AndPic]]], with the one advantage that it doesn't require a picture variable (of course, if you had two such lists, you could easily use [[[68k:NewPic]]] to create a picture variable).
