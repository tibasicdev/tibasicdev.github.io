description: 'This is the Solitaire Encryption algorithm that Bruce Schneier made for Neal Stephenson''s book Cryptonomicon. Before, only a TI89 version of the program existed. This is for the TI83/84s. Give your calc some time, and eventually something will come out encrypted/decrypted. The outputs are stored in Str1 and the decryption deck is stored in ∟DDECK.'
