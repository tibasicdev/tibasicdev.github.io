[[include inc:markup cmd=^^r^^]]

Normally, when the calculator is in degree mode, the trigonometric functions only return values calculated in degrees.  With the {{^^r^^}} symbol you can have the angle evaluated as if in radian mode because it converts the angle into degrees.

One full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°.  To convert an angle in radians to degrees you multiply by 180/π, and to convert from degrees to radians multiply by π/180.

In degree mode:
[[code]]
sin(π)		\\sine of Pi degrees
	.0548036651
sin(π^^r)
	0
[[/code]]
In radian mode:
[[code]]
sin(π)
	0
sin(π^^r)
	0		\\There's no difference when in radians
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

When you only call the trig function once in a program and want it calculated in radians, instead of changing the mode you can just use {{°}} to save one-byte (the newline from using the command {{Radian}})

[[code]]
:Radian
:sin(X)
can be
:sin(X^^r)
[[/code]]
