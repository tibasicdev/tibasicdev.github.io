When uwAxes is enabled, and the calculator is in [[[seq-mode|Seq]]] mode, the equations u and w will be graphed against each other (that is, the points (u(//n//),w(//n//)) are graphed for the values of //n// between //n//Min and //n//Max). With this setting, sequence mode graphs are a bit like [[[param|parametric]]] mode, except the parameter //n// is always an integer, and recursive definitions are possible.

The equation v is ignored when in uwAxes mode.

See "Related Commands" for other possibilities of graphing sequences.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** is thrown if either u or w is undefined.
