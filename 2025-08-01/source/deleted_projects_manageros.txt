[!-- Fill in a short description here --]
This is a Celtic 3 program that allows you to do things that a Non-Celtic 3 program would do. Requires Celtic 3 to be installed, and requires at least 3000 bytes of RAM to use (even when you run the program, a little ram [130 bytes] is taken away when a program is ran)
File will be posted soon
