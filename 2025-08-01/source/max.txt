{{max(X,Y)}} returns the largest of the two numbers {{X}} and {{Y}}. {{max(//list//)}} returns the largest element of //list//. {{max(//list1//,//list2//)}} returns the pairwise maxima of the two lists. {{max(//list1//,X)}} (equivalently, {{max(X,//list1//)}}) returns a list whose elements are the larger of {{X}} or the corresponding element of the original list.

[[code]]
max(2,3)
     3
max({2,3,4})
     4
max({1,3},{4,2})
     {4 3}
max({1,3},2)
     {2 3}
[[/code]]

Unlike comparison operators such as < and >, {{max(}} can also compare complex numbers. To do this, both arguments must be complex -- either complex numbers or complex lists: {{max(2,//i//)}} will throw an error even though {{max(2+0//i//,//i//)}} won't. In the case of complex numbers, the number with the largest absolute value will be returned. When the two numbers have the same absolute value, the first one will be returned: {{max(//i//,-//i//)}} returns //i// and {{max(-//i//,//i//)}} returns -//i//.

+ Advanced Uses

{{max(}} can be used in Boolean comparisons to see if at least one of a list is 1 (true) -- useful because commands like {{[[[If]]]}} or {{[[[While]]]}} only deal with numbers, and not lists, but comparisons like {{L₁=L₂}} return a list of values. In general, the behavior you want varies, and you will use the {{[[[min(]]]}} function or the {{max(}} function accordingly.

Using {{max(}} will give you a lenient test -- if any one element of the list is 1 (true), then the {{max(}} of the list is true -- this is equivalent to putting an {{[[[or]]]}} in between every element. For example, this tests if K is equal to any of 24, 25, 26, or 34 (the {{[[[getKey]]]}} arrow key values):

[[code]]
:If max(K={24,25,26,34
:Disp "ARROW KEY
[[/code]]

To get the element of a real list in {{[[[Ans]]]}} with the greatest absolute value, use {{imag(max(//i//Ans))}} or {{max(abs(Ans))}}.

{{max(}} can be also used along with {{min(}} to constrain a value between a lower and upper number:

[[code]]
:max(-1,min(1,100)) // returns 1 because 1 is between -1 & 100
:max(-1,min(1,0)) // returns 0 because 1 is not between -1 & 0
[[/code]]

where the bounds for which the number 1 must fall between are first argument of {{max(}} and the second argument of {{min(}} in the above code.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown when comparing a real and a complex number. This can be avoided by adding +0//i// to the real number (or //i^4// right after it, for those who are familiar with complex numbers)
* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown, when using {{max(}} with two lists, if they have different dimensions.
