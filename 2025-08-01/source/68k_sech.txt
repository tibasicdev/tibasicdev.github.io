The {{sech()}} command returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicSecant.html hyperbolic secant] of a number. Along with 11 other trig and hyperbolic functions, it was added in AMS version 2.07; on earlier versions, {{sech(x)}} can be replaced by 1/{{cosh(x)}}.

As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{sech()}} can be used with complex numbers according to the rule that {{sech(**//i//**x)}}={{sec(x)}} and {{sec(**//i//**x)}}={{sech(x)}}. This rule only works in radian mode, and {{sech()}} of a complex number will return a domain error when working in degrees or gradians.

Occasionally, {{sech()}} can compute an exact result; most of the time, the calculator will leave an expression with {{sech()}} alone unless it's in approximate mode (or you [[[68k:approx|force an approximation]]]). When {{sech()}} is used with symbolic expressions, the calculator can go back and forth between the {{sech()}} expression and its exponential equivalent.

:sech(0)
           1
:expand(sech(x))
          2*e^x/((e^x)^2+1)
:comDenom(2*e^x/((e^x)^2+1))
          1/cosh(x)

If {{sech()}} is applied to a list, it will take the hyperbolic secant of every element in the list. However, it can't be applied to matrices the way {{cosh()}} can (this is probably an oversight; all the trig and hyperbolic functions that were present in all AMS versions work with matrices, but the ones added in version 2.07 do not).

+ Formulas

The definition of hyperbolic secant is, by analogy with {{[[[68k:sec()]]]}}, the reciprocal of {{[[[68k:cosh()]]]}}:

[[include inc:68k-math eqn=\operatorname{sech}{x}=\frac{1}{\cosh{x}} = \frac{2}{e^x+e^{-x}}]]
