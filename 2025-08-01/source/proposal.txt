Welcome to the TI-83 section of TI-Basic Developer (TI|BD)! This section of the site covers how to make TI-Basic programs for the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition (SE), TI-84+, and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators (often abbreviated as TI-83/84/+/SE). After going through all of the TI-83 information, the reader should be a competent TI-83 Basic programmer.

We've tried to create a broad base of TI-Basic information. This ensures that most readers will hopefully be able to learn something from this site. Experimentation is encouraged to fully digest all of the information.

Please use our search engine to find what you desire, or refer to the [[[sitemap]]].

Each reader can read the information in whatever order they desire. For the average reader, though, the suggested approach is to just start from the beginning and read until the end. The information is presented in a sequential order, with the concepts and code getting increasingly more complex as you get further into it. You might also look at the page [[[using-this-guide|Using This Guide]]], which outlines another suggested reading order.

Please feel free to not only [[[contribute|get involved]]], but also come back often to see what changes or additions have been made. And above all else, enjoy your stay!
