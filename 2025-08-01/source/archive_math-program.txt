description: "Has a menu that links to the following functions:\n\nEquation:\nThis solves for X.\nFirst, enter in the left side. Then the right side. X will be displayed if the equation is solvable. If the\nequation is not solvable, there may be an error. If an error occurs, do not try and edit the program. The error\nis with the equation you gave it. Make sure to close all parentheses or the equation will be interpreted wrong.\n\nQuadratic Solver:\nSolves a quadratic equation. Pretty self explanatory.\n\nSimultaneous Solver:\nSolves for x and y when given two equations of the form ax+by=c.\n\nRadical Simplifier:\nI got this program from https://www.mcelroytutoring.com/blog-post.php?id=4332&title=10+Helpful+ACT+Math+Calculator+Programs+for+the+TI+Graphing+Series+of+Calculators\nAll credit goes to them.\nThis program is pretty self explanatory. It simplifies radicals.\n\nMean, Median:\nEnter in a list of the form {element1, element2, ..., elementN}.\nThe program will display the mean and the median of the list.\n\nSequence:\nFirst enter in the first term of the sequence. Then enter in the change number and 0 or 1 respectively depending on\nwhether each consecutive term of the sequence should have the change number added to it or multiplied by it. Then enter\nin the number of terms of this sequence you want to calculate. The resulting sequence will be displayed and stored in L1.\nThe last term of the sequence is also displayed. Example: Input: 1ST TERM:2, COMMON D:5, N TERMS:4, CHOICE?1\nOutput: {2 10 50 250}, 250\nThis is helpful on math problems that deal with arithmetic and geometric sequences.\n\nPythagorean Solver:\nEnter the variable in the pythagorean theorem you want to solve for. Then enter the values of the other two variables. The\nvalue of the variable you chose to solve for will be displayed. Example:\nInput: SOLVE FOR:C,A=7,B=24\nOutput: C=25\nThis is helpful in geometry and trigonometry classes.\n\nDistance, Midpoint, Slope:\nThis will ask you for two points, (X1, Y1) and (X2,Y2), and then display the distance between the points, the midpoint of the\npoints, and the slope of the connecting line between the points.\n\nFormulas:\nDisplays random formulas I've needed to 'remember'. When you see \"MORE...\", press [ENTER] to continue."
