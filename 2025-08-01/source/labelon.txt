The {{LabelOn}} setting enables labels on the X and Y coordinate axes. If both {{LabelOn}}and {{[[[AxesOn]]]}} are set, the axes will be displayed with an X next to the X (horizontal) axis, and a Y next to the Y (vertical) axis. To disable these labels, use the {{[[[LabelOff]]]}} setting.

{{LabelOn}} and {{LabelOff}} have no effect if the coordinate axes aren't displayed; there's nothing to label.

A somewhat quirky behavior of the X and Y labels is that they aren't saved by {{[[[StorePic]]]}}. If you save a picture of the graph screen, it records every detail of the way it looks, including equations, drawn elements, axes, grid, everything -- but not the labels.

One final comment: okay, so by the way the command works we know it was once //intended// to label the axes. However, the command doesn't actually check where the axes //are//. It puts an "x" slightly above the bottom right corner, and a "y" slightly below the top left. Most of the time, including the default graphing window, that doesn't help you to distinguish the axes in the slightest. And in split-screen mode, as shown in the screenshot, they both seem to label the x-axis. Weird.
