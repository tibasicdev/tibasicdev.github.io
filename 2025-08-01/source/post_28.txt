content: "Hi, I am Zeda, also known as Xeda. I am a moderator here on TI-Basic Developer and I am sure many of y'all are familiar with me. With the new site change, I figured I would help populate the Introductions forum, though. So, about me:\n\n* I have been programming the TI-83+/84+ series for around six years, now.\n* I have a TI-84+, TI-84+SE, and a TI-89t.\n* I program in TI-BASIC and Z80 Assembly and I often help out by supplying assembly hexcodes for things that cannot be easily done in BASIC.\n* I am a moderator here and on several other sites.\n* I am in college, majoring in mathematics. I have also tutored highschoolers.\n* I am almost 21 and I am married :)\n* I was a museum tour guide for a few years. Basically, I just like teaching and helping people out.\n\nFeel free to ask me stuff! I've worked quite a bit with TI-BASIC and z80 assembly, so even if I am not the most knowledgeable, I might know something!"
