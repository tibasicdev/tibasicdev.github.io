This command stores the contents of an equation variable (such as Y,,1,, or X,,1T,,) to a string (one of Str0, Str1, ... Str9). This can be used when you want to display the equation as text (either using the {{[[[Text(]]]}} command on the graph screen, or the {{[[[Output(]]]}} or {{[[[Disp]]]}} commands on the home screen). For example:

[[code]]
:Equ►String(Y1,Str1
:Text(0,0,"Y1(X)=",Str1
[[/code]]

Apart from cases in which the user has already stored to the equation variable prior to running the program, about the only situation in which you would use {{Equ►String(}} is for the output of a [[[regression-models|regression]]].

+ Advanced

You can use {{Equ►String(}} (outside a program) to get the {{[[[store|→]]]}} or " symbols in a string:

# Type them on the home screen and press [ENTER]
# Select 2:Quit when the **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** comes up.
# Press [Y=] to go to the equation editor.
# Press [2nd] [ENTRY] to recall the symbols to Y,,1,,
# Now, use {{Equ►String(}}Y,,1,,,Str1{{)}} to store the symbols to a string.
