{{sin(θ)}} returns the [*https://www.mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html Sine] of θ
[[[sin|Unlike its TI-83/84 counterpart]]] which can only be a real number, or a list thereof, the nSpire version can also be used on complex numbers, as well as a list/matrix of complex numbers.

{{sin(}} is affected by the document angle setting

On CAS calculators^^(CAS only or non-CAS as well?)^^, {{sin(θ)}} can result in exact representations if θ is a value such as [[$\pi/3$]]
