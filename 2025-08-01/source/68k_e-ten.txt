The [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]] symbol is used for entering numbers in scientific notation: it's short for *10^. Like TI-83 Basic, the exponent of [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]] must be a constant integer, however unlike TiBz80 the range of values is not finite.

The [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]] symbol is used in display by the calculator for approximations of very small numbers, or when in {{[[[Sci]]]}} (scientific) or {{[[[Eng]]]}} (engineering) mode. Interestingly, the calculator will opt to display large numbers without approximation, but it will only solve for a maximum of 12 decimal places before rounding or using [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]].

Unlike the exponent of [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]], the mantissa (a special term for the A in A*10^B, in scientific notation) isn't limited to constants alone: it can be a real or complex variable or expression, a list, a matrix, or even omitted entirely (and then it will be assumed to equal 1). The reason for this versatility is simple: internally, only the exponent is taken to be an actual argument for this command. The rest of the calculation is done through implied multiplication.

+ Optimization

Don't add the mantissa when it's 1: 

[[include inc:prgm-code
|code=
1[[size 75%]]E[[/size]]5
could be
[[size 75%]]E[[/size]]5
]]

In addition, [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]]2 or [[size 75%]]{{E}}[[/size]]3 can be used as shorthand ways of writing 100 and 1000 respectively. This could be continued, in theory, for higher powers of 10, but those aren't necessary as often.
