The {{getTmFmt(}} command returns the current time format of the clock on the TI-84+/SE/CE calculators as an integer. There are two different time formats available: 12 (12 hour) and 24 (24 hours). You can store this value to a [[[variables|variable]]] for later use. Of course, this command only works if the time format has actually been set, so you should use the {{[[[setTmFmt(]]]}} command before using it.
