summary: 'Horner''s method is a algorithm to divide a polynom by (x-a)  ( From wikipedia:[In mathematics, Horner''s method is either of two things: (i) an algorithm for calculating polynomials, which consists of transforming the monomial form into a computationally efficient form;[2] or (ii) a method for approximating the roots of a polynomial. The latter is also known as Ruffini–Horner''s method.])'
description: 'A simple graphical program to use Horner''s method. There may be some bugs. Coefficients and a''s are inputted in this form => a,b,c,d,e.... max 7 coefficients.'
