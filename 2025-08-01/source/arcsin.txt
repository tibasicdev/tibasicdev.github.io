sinֿ¹( returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseSine.html arcsine] of its argument. It is the inverse of [[[sin(]]], which means that sinֿ¹(z) produces an angle θ such that sin(θ)=z.

Like sin(, the result of sinֿ¹( depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] mode. However, unlike sine, the result is in degrees or radians, not the argument. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion of θ=sinֿ¹(n) from radians to degrees is θ*180/π and from degrees to radians is θ*π/180. The sinֿ¹( command also works on lists.

The sinֿ¹( function can be defined for all real and complex numbers; however, the function assumes real values only in the closed interval [-1,1]. Because the trigonometric functions and their inverses in the Z80 calculators are restricted only to real values, the calculator will throw [[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]] if the argument is outside of this interval, no matter what the mode setting may be.

In radians:

In degrees:

+ Advanced Uses

Since the function sine itself doesn't have the restrictions that arcsine does, and since arcsine is the inverse of sine, you can use sinֿ¹(sin( to keep a variable within a certain range (most useful on the [[[graphscreen|graph screen]]]). Here is an example for a game like [[[pong]]]. The ball travels between -6 and 6.

You could use a flag like this:
[[code]]
:If 6=abs(X		\\ X is the position
:-D→D		\\ D is the direction
:X+D→X		\\ new position
:Pt-On(-54,X,"=")
[[/code]]

An easier way to do this, without needing a flag or even an If statement, is using sinֿ¹(sin(
[[code]]
:X+1→X		\\ Note: the calculator is in degree mode
:Pt-On(-54,sinֿ¹(sin(15X))/15,"=")	\\ 15 is used because sinֿ¹ ranges from [-90,90]
										and X from [-6,6],  so 90/6=15

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you input a complex value or a matrix.
* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if you supplied an argument outside the interval [-1,1]
