{{cosֿ¹(}} returns the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseCosine.html arccosine] of its argument. It is the inverse of {{[[[cos(]]]}}, which means that {{cosֿ¹(n)}} produces an angle θ such that {{cos(θ)}}=n.

Like {{cos(}}, the result of {{cosֿ¹(}} depends on whether the calculator is in [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] or [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] mode. However, unlike cosine, the result is in degrees or radians, not the argument. A full rotation around a circle is 2π radians, which is equal to 360°. The conversion of θ={{cosֿ¹(n)}} from radians to degrees is θ*180/π and from degrees to radians is θ*π/180.  The {{cosֿ¹(}} command also works on a list.

The {{cosֿ¹(}} function can be defined for all real and complex numbers, but assumes real values only in the closed interval [-1,1]. Because Z80 calculators have their trigonometric functions and inverses restricted only to real values, the calculator will throw [[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]] if the argument is outside of this interval, no matter what the mode setting may be.

In radians:
[[code]]
:cosֿ¹(-1)
    3.141592654
[[/code]]
In degrees:
[[code]]
:cosֿ¹(-1)
    180
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

Since the function cosine itself doesn't have the restrictions that arccosine does, and since arccosine is the inverse of cosine, you can use {{cosֿ¹(cos(}} to keep a variable within a certain range (most useful for the [[[homescreen|home screen]]]). Here is an example for a game like [[[pong]]]. The ball travels between 0 and 12.

You could use a flag like this:
[[code]]
:If X=12 or not(X 	\\ X is the position
:-D→D		\\ D is the direction
:X+D→X		\\ new position
:Output(8,X,"=
[[/code]]

An easier way to do this, without needing a flag or even an {{[[[If]]]}} statement, is using {{cosֿ¹(cos(}}
[[code]]
:X+1→X		\\ Note: the calculator is in Degree mode
:Output(8,cosֿ¹(cos(15X))/15,"=")	\\ I used 15 because cosֿ¹ ranges from [0,180]
										and X from [0,12],  so 180/12=15
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** is thrown if you supplied an argument outside the interval [-1,1]
* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you input a complex value or a matrix.
