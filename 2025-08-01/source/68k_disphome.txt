The DispHome command returns the user to the homescreen. This is very useful in a program that uses the I/O screen since ending a program with a command like [[[68k:Stop]]] will not automatically return the user to the homescreen. Take this example:
[[code]]
Prompt a
Pause
DispHome
[[/code]]
This code will ask for a value for "a", then go to the homescreen. Had you not put the DispHome command there, you would have stayed at the I/O screen, which in some cases can be confusing.

+ Optimization

The DispHome command also combines the functionality of the [[[68k:Stop]]] command. For example
[[code]]
DispHome
Stop

can be

DispHome
[[/code]]
