The ∠ operator is used for alternate forms of entering vectors or complex numbers. It will be used for output depending on the Complex Format and Vector Format [[[68k:mode settings]]], but you can always use it in an expression.

For vectors (which are just 1x2 or 1x3 matrices, as far as ∠ is concerned):
* [r,∠θ] is equivalent to [r*cos(θ),r*sin(θ)]
* [r,∠θ,z] is equivalent to [r*cos(θ),r*sin(θ),z]
* [r,∠θ,∠φ] is equivalent to [r*cos(θ)*sin(φ),r*sin(θ)*sin(φ),r*cos(φ)]
These have to be row vectors -- you can't use column vectors with ∠.

For complex numbers, (r∠θ) is equivalent to r*(cos(θ)+//**i**//*sin(θ)). You have to have the parentheses there, and both r and θ must be real numbers or expressions.
