Calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a value. The hyperbolic trig functions {{[[[sinh(]]]}}, {{cosh(}}, and {{[[[tanh(]]]}} are an analog of normal trig functions, but for a hyperbola, rather than a circle. They can be expressed in terms of real powers of {{[[[e-value|e]]]}}, and don't depend on the [[[degree-mode|Degree]]] or [[[radian-mode|Radian]]] mode setting.

Like normal trig commands, {{cosh(}} works on [[[lists]]] as well, but not on complex numbers, even though the function is often extended to the complex numbers in mathematics.
