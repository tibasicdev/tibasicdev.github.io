Reign of Legends is a full-length RPG, which features a good storyline with over 15 hours of gameplay, 3 playable characters, quality graphics and magic animations, four world maps, over seventy enemies, thirty locations with over 1,000 screens, and many mini-games and side-quests.

Of course, none of this is cheap in the memory department. The game literally takes up over 120KB in archive, with it spread out to almost fifty different programs (in particular, each of the maps and bosses are given their own program), and you need to have several of them unarchived in order to actually play the game. Of course, this does not include the actual in game usages that occurs from using all of the real variables, lists, matrices, and strings.

Still, the game is a great achievement in TI-Basic, and surely stretches what people thought is possible.
