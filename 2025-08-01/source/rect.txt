The ►Rect command can be used when displaying a complex number on the home screen, or with the [[[Disp]]] and [[[Pause]]] commands. It will then format the number as though [[[a+bi]]] mode were enabled, even when it's not. It also works with lists.

It will also work when displaying a number by putting it on the last line of a program by itself. It does **not** work with [[[Output(]]], [[[Text(]]], or any other more complicated display commands.

To actually separate a number into the components of rectangular form, use [[[real-func|real(]]] and [[[imag(]]].
