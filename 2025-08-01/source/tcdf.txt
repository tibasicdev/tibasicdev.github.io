tcdf( is the Student's //t// cumulative density function. If some random variable follows this distribution, you can use this command to find the probability that this variable will fall in the interval you supply.

Unlike [[[normalcdf(]]], this command only works for the standardized distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. To use it for non-standardized values you will have to standardize them by calculating (X-μ)/σ (where μ is the mean and σ the standard deviation). Do this for both //lower// and //upper//. 

+ Advanced

Often, you want to find a "tail probability" - a special case for which the interval has no lower or no upper bound (the form frequently used in one-tailed tests). For example, "what is the probability x is greater than 2?". The TI-83+ has no special symbol for infinity, but you can use E99 to get a very large number that will work equally well in this case ([[[e-ten|E]]] is the decimal exponent obtained by pressing [2nd] [EE]). Use E99 for +∞, and -E99 for -∞.

Alternatively, you can exploit the identity

[[math]]
\operatorname{tcdf}(-\infty,0,\nu)=\frac1{2}
[[/math]]

(similarly for the interval from 0 to ∞)

and thus

[[math]]
\operatorname{tcdf}(-\infty,x,\nu)=\frac1{2}+\operatorname{tcdf}(0,x,\nu)
[[/math]]

For the form used in two-tailed tests, the following identity may be useful:

[[math]]
\operatorname{tcdf}(-x,x,\nu)=2\operatorname{tcdf}(0,x,\nu)
[[/math]]

+ Formulas

As with any other continuous distribution, tcdf( can be defined in terms of the probability density function, [[[tpdf(]]]:

[[math]]
\operatorname{tcdf}(a,b,\nu)=\int_a^b \operatorname{tpdf}(t,\nu)\mathrm{d}t
[[/math]]

The function can also be expressed in terms of an [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IncompleteBetaFunction.html incomplete beta function].

For one degree of freedom (ν=1), tcdf( is expressible in terms of simpler functions:

[[math]]
\operatorname{tcdf}(a,b,1)=\frac1{\pi}\left(\tan^{-1}\left(b\right)-\tan^{-1}\left(a\right)\right)
[[/math]]

This is the so-called Cauchy distribution.
