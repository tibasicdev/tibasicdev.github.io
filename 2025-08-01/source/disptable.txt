The {{DispTable}} comand displays the table screen you normally see by pressing 2nd TABLE, from a running program. The user will see the table screen with a "paused" run indicator, and will be able to use arrows to scroll through it. Pressing ENTER will exit the screen and continue the program.

+ Advanced Uses

The user can't select any cells in the table to be evaluated if they're not, already. So it's best to select the {{[[[IndpntAuto]]]}} and {{[[[DependAuto]]]}} options from the 2nd TBLSET menu before using this command. {{[[[IndpntAsk]]]}} can also work, however, as long as you store to {{[[[system-variables#window|TblInput]]]}} first.

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#invalid|ERR:INVALID]]]** occurs if this statement is used outside a program.
