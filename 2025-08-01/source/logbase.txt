The {{logBASE(}} command is a visual upgrade to the {{[[[log|log(]]]}} command to compute logarithms in any base //b//. That is, the command finds the exponent that base //b// must be raised to obtain the given value.

This command can be used on both the home screen and while programming.  If you are using {{[[[classic-mode|CLASSIC]]]}} mode, the command appears as:

[[code]]
logBASE(8,2)
            3
[[/code]]

But in [[[mathprint-mode|MATHPRINT]]] mode, this is improved to:

[[div class="code"]]
log,,2,,(8)
@<&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>@3
[[/div]]

+ Formulas

The log in base //b// can also be found using the {{[[[ln(]]]}} or {{[[[log(]]]}} commands.  This can be done indirectly using the change-of-base formula:

[[math]]
\log_bx = {\ln x \over \ln b} = {\log x \over \log b}
[[/math]]

Or directly, using the optional second argument of {{log(}}:

[[code]]
logBASE(X,B

can be

log(X,B
[[/code]]

The {{logBASE(}} command costs one extra byte compared to {{log(}}, providing only a visual improvement over its counterpart in {{MATHPRINT}} mode. The {{log(}} command is also compatible with older OS's, although its second argument is not. Both {{logBASE(}} and the second argument of {{log(}} are disabled in exam mode.

* **[[[errors#domain|ERR:DOMAIN]]]** when trying to compute the logarithm of 0
* **[[[errors#nonrealans|ERR:NONREAL ANS]]]** when trying to compute the logarithm of a negative number in {{[[[real-mode|Real]]]}} mode
