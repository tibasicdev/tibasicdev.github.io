The → (store) command will store a number, variable, or expression to a variable, using the respective value(s) of the variable(s) at the time. When storing a value in a variable, you have the value on the left side of → and the variable that it will be stored to on the right side.

[[code]]
:1→X
           1

:{1.3,5.7,9.11→ABC
           {1.3 5.7 9.11}

:"HELLO WORLD→Str1
           "HELLO WORLD"
[[/code]]

+ Advanced

It's not easy to put a → symbol into a string, since "→→Str1 would produce a syntax error (and in general, when the calculator 'sees' a → symbol, it assumes that the string is over, and interprets the symbol literally).

However, you can use [[[Equ►String(]]] (outside a program) to get the → or " symbols in a string:

# Type them on the home screen and press [ENTER]
# Select 1:Quit when the **[[[errors#syntax|ERR:SYNTAX]]]** comes up.
# Press [Y=] to go to the equation editor.
# Press [2nd] [ENTRY] to recall the symbols to Y,,1,,
# Now, use Equ►String(Y,,1,,,Str1) to store the symbols to a string.

+ Optimization

You can remove closing parentheses, braces, brackets, and quotes that are before a → command.

Here are a series of examples of using the → command. The first line of each example uses more bytes than necessary. The line following strips out the unnecessary characters and uses less bytes.

++++ Real Variables

[[code]]
1/(2*(3/4))→X
1/(2(3/4→X
[[/code]]

++++ Strings

[[code]]
"Hello"→Str1
"Hello→Str1
[[/code]]

++++ Lists

[[code]]
{1,2,3,2(X+1)}→L₁
{1,2,3,2(X+1→L₁
[[/code]]

[[code]]
5→L₁(1)
5→L₁(1
[[/code]]

[[code]]
{4,5,6}→∟LISTX
{4,5,6→LISTX
[[/code]]

Tip: You can remove the {{∟}} character when storing an entire list to a custom named list, but you must keep the {{∟}} character present when storing to a specific item, such as {{3→∟LISTX(1}}
