This command is used to calculate cumulative geometric probability. In plainer language, it solves a specific type of often-encountered probability problem, that occurs under the following conditions:
# A specific event has only two outcomes, which we will call "success" and "failure"
# The event is going to keep happening until a success occurs
# Success or failure is determined randomly with the same probability of success each time the event occurs
# We're interested in the probability that it takes **at most** a specific amount of trials to get a success.

For example, consider a basketball player that always makes a shot with 1/4 probability. He will keep throwing the ball until he makes a shot. What is the probability that it takes him no more than 4 shots?

# The event here is throwing the ball. A "success", obviously, is making the shot, and a "failure" is missing.
# The event is going to happen until he makes the shot: a success.
# The probability of a success - making a shot - is 1/4
# We're interested in the probability that it takes at most 4 trials to get a success
 
The syntax here is {{geometcdf(//probability//, //trials//)}}. In this case:
[[code]]
:geometcdf(1/4,4
[[/code]]
This will give about .684 when you run it, so there's a .684 probability that he'll make a shot within 4 throws.

Note the relationship between {{[[[geometpdf(]]]}} and {{geometcdf(}}. Since {{geometpdf(}} is the probability it will take **exactly** N trials, we can write that {{geometcdf(1/4,4) = geometpdf(1/4,1) + geometpdf(1/4,2) + geometpdf(1/4,3) + geometpdf(1/4,4)}}.

+ Formulas

Going off of the relationship between {{geometpdf(}} and {{geometcdf(}}, we can write a formula for {{geometcdf(}} in terms of {{geometpdf(}}:

[[math]]
\operatorname{geometcdf}(p,n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname{geometpdf}(p,i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p\,(1-p)^{i-1}
[[/math]]

(If you're unfamiliar with sigma notation, [[$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} $]] just means "add up the following for all values of i from 1 to n")

However, we can take a shortcut to arrive at a much simpler expression for {{geometcdf(}}. Consider the opposite probability to the one we're interested in, the probability that it will **not** take "at most N trials", that is, the probability that it will take more than N trials. This means that the first N trials are failures. So {{geometcdf(p,N)}} = (1 - "probability that the first N trials are failures"), or:

[[math]]
\operatorname{geometcdf}(p,n) = 1-(1-p)^n
