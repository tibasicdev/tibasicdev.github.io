summary: 'Token Finder+ is a unique tool for accessing inaccessible tokens on your graphing calculator.'
description: "Token Finder+ is a special tool for accessing inaccessible tokens on your graphing calculator\nthat you couldn't do in pure TI-BASIC. Meaning, you can get any token or ASCII character\nyou ever dreamed of on your calculator. It also contains a Spanish version of the program and Read Me!\n\n+++ Version 3.6 \n\n3.6 includes further optimizations, memory decrease, and a better validation process at the beginning of the program. The validation process checks to see if all the hex values in the {{TokenHex}} application variable are usable. Must be 4 characters long, 0-9 & A-F. If the validation fails, the application variable will be deleted. Faster separate deletions will be added too, and some minor bug fixes in the code.\n\n+++ Version 3.7 coming later\n\n* Added a copy of the hex code alongside with the downloaded characters/tokens.\n* Manage the download (preview, edit, delete lines, the entire file)\n* Prevent user from downloading/saving bad tokens (i.e. #EF4C)\n* Quick Copy - When viewing hexes, you can quickly download a single one into the TOKENS program."
