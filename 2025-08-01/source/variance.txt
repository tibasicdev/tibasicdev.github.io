The {{variance(}} command finds the sample variance of a list, a measure of the spread of a distribution. It takes a list of real numbers as a parameter. For example:

[[code]]
:Prompt L1
:Disp "VARIANCE OF L1",variance(L1
[[/code]]

+ Advanced Uses

Frequency lists don't need to be whole numbers; your calculator can handle being told that one element of the list occurs 1/3 of a time, and another occurs 22.7 times. It can even handle a frequency of 0 - it will just ignore that element, as though it weren't there.

+ Formulas

The formula for variance used by this command is:

[[include inc:math
|eqn = s_n^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2
]]

This is the formula for sample variance. The formula for population variance, which this command does **not** use, varies slightly:

[[include inc:math
|eqn = \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2
]]

If the population variance is required, just multiply the result of {{variance()}} by [[$ 1-1/N $]].

With frequencies //w,,i,,//, the formula becomes

[[include inc:math
|eqn = s_n^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N (w_i)-1}
]]

where [[$ \overline{x} $]] is the mean with frequencies included.
