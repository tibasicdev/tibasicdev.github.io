The {{GridDot}} command enables a grid of dots on the graph screen (you can disable it with the {{[[[GridOff]]]}} command). How fine or coarse the grid is depends on the {{[[[system-variables#window|Xscl]]]}} and {{[[[system-variables#window|Yscl]]]}} variables. Drawing the grid just involves plotting points all the points of the form (A×{{Xscl}}, B×{{Yscl}}) that are in the graphing window. The grid can be any colored defined by a color variable or value.

[[code]]
:GridDot BLUE    //creates a grid of blue dots
:GridDot 12       //creates a grid of black dots
