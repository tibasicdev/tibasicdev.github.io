summary: 'Shows a model of a prism in 3D.'
description: "This program is able to rotate and resize a model, and also change its vertex count.\nIt isn't the fastest - neither is it smooth, but that's kind of a restriction on the calculator's hardware.\nOnly assembly would make ik quicker, although I'm not experienced in that language.\n\nA port can be made to TI-84+ calculators - the only reason it isn't for the non-color calculators is the drawing coordinates;\nTI-84+C calculators have a resolution almost 3 times bigger than the regular TI-84's.\nWith enough notice I'll create such a version.\n\n====CONTROLS====\n[ENTER]: Quit program\n[(] or [)]: Change vertexcount. This is for the top and bottom face only.\n[Arrow keys]: Rotate model.\n[-] or [+]: Change model size."
