The {{GridOn}} command enables a grid on the graph screen (you can disable it again with the {{[[[GridOff]]]}} command). How fine or coarse the grid is depends on the {{[[[system-variables#window|Xscl]]]}} and {{[[[system-variables#window|Yscl]]]}} variables. Drawing the grid just involves plotting points all the points of the form ({{A*Xscl}}, {{B*Yscl}}) that are in the graphing window. The grid is often used in games such as Dots & Boxes, Tic-Tac-Toe, and 2D puzzles.

On the TI-84+CSE and TI-84+CE, an additional argument may be used to set the color of the grid:

[[code]]
:GridOn GRAY
[[/code]]

Like other drawing commands, the color may be replaced by its numerical value (ranging from 10 to 24).

+ Advanced Uses

{{GridOn}} can be used to shade the entire screen if {{Xscl}} and {{Yscl}} are small enough that the points on the grid are one pixel apart:
[[code]]
:ΔX→Xscl
:ΔY→Yscl
:GridOn
[[/code]]

This is one of the shortest ways to shade the screen, although {{[[[Shade(]]]}} can be used for a (usually) even shorter way. However, using {{GridOn}} is also very slow: the fastest way involves the {{[[[Horizontal]]]}} or the {{[[[Vertical]]]}} commands in a {{[[[For(]]]}} loop (or the {{[[[BackgroundOn]]]}} command for color calculators).
