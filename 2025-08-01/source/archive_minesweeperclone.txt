summary: 'A moderately advanced clone of minesweeper built on the Ti-84 Plus.'
description: 'This minesweeper clone is built in the graph and uses the cursor to navigate the board. Programmed entirely in TI-Basic. Runs fast and uses a matrix for mine location storage. Has a button at bottom of the screen ("F") to switch between mine and flag modes. Please post any bugs you find and I will fix them as soon as possible. Only works and Ti 84 devices with a screen size of 94 x 62 pixels due to the use of the graph. More features will be added as they are programmed. Feel free to post suggestions for features'
