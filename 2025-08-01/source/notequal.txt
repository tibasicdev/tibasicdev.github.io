The ≠ (not equal) operator takes two numbers, variables, or expressions, and tests to see if they are not equal to each other. It will return 1 if they are not, and 0 if they are. When determining the order of operations, ≠ will be executed after the [[[operators#math|math]]] operators, but it will be executed before the [[[operators#logical|logical]]] operators and in the order that it appears from left to right with the other [[[operators#relational|relational]]] operators.

+ Advanced Uses

Just like the other relational operators, ≠ can take real numbers and lists for variables. In order to compare the lists, however, both must have the same dimensions; if they don't, the calculator will throw a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error. When comparing a real number to a list, the calculator will actually compare the number against each element in the list and return a list of 1s and 0s accordingly.

[[code]]
:{2,4,6,8}≠{1,3,5,7
           {1 1 1 1}
:5≠{1,2,3,4,5
           {1 1 1 1 0}
[[/code]]

Besides real numbers and lists, ≠ also allows you compare strings, matrices, and complex numbers. However, the variables must be of the same type, otherwise the calculator will throw a [[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]] error; and just like with lists, both matrices must have the same dimensions, otherwise you will get a [[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]] error.

[[code]]
:[[1,2,3]]≠[[1,2,3
           0
:"HELLO"≠"WORLD
           1
:(3+4i)≠(5-2i)    (the parentheses are added for clarity)
           1
[[/code]]

+ Optimization

Don't compare a variable's value to zero in a conditional expression, because the calculator treats nonzero values as true and zero as false. Instead, just write the variable by itself:

[[code]]
:If C≠0
can be
:If C
[[/code]]

+ Error Conditions

* **[[[errors#datatype|ERR:DATA TYPE]]]** is thrown if you try to compare two different kinds of variables, such as a string and number or a list and matrix.
* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if you try to compare two lists or matrices that have different dimensions.
