[!--
 This page is a guide to both format and content for pages describing a particular routine. Make sure that you follow it when adding a new routine, and also remember to add 3-5 page tags describing the routine content. It may be useful to copy the code for this page and edit it as necessary, when creating a new routine page.

If a section (such as Error Conditions) does not contain any information, feel free to omit it.

[[include inc:routine

|summary=A short description of what the routine does.

|input=The variable(s) that you need to setup to to use the routine.
//Variable 1// - What it is used for
//Variable 2// - What it is used for

|output=The variable(s) that the routine stores to at the end.
//Variable 1// - What it contains
//Variable 2// - What it contains

|variable=The variables used in the routine.

List the variables one after another, separating each with a comma.
|compatibility=The calculator(s) that the routine works on.

Separate each calculator with a slash when displaying the calculators. For example, the following line means the routine works on every calculator.

:The code of the routine
:should be included here
[[/code]]

An explanation of the routine, including how it works, how you can modify it, what variables it uses, and anything else that is important to know when using the routine. The explanation should be thorough enough so that a person can use the routine without requiring help from somebody else.

+ Error Conditions

For the non-generic errors that might occur when using this command (that is, syntax-type errors shouldn't be included). In a format similar to the following:

* **[[[errors#dimmismatch|ERR:DIM MISMATCH]]]** is thrown if the two list arguments have different dimensions.
* **[[[errors#reserved|ERR:RESERVED]]]** is thrown if ∟RESID is supplied as an argument.

+ Related Routines

There are several routines that are similar in functionality or are used in a similar context. Make a bulleted list of them, with links to the other routines' pages. It will often be the case that several routines all link to each other.

* Routine 1
* Routine 2
* Routine 3
