The {{sec()}} command returns the secant (the reciprocal of the [[[68k:cos|cosine]]]) of an angle measure. Naturally, the result depends on the angle [[[68k:setmode|mode]]] the calculator is in: radian, degree, or (in AMS version 3.10) gradian. You can also use one of the ^^[[[68k:radian|r]]]^^, [[[68k:degree|°]]], ^^[[[68k:gradian|G]]]^^ marks to specify an angle mode.

The {{sec()}} command, along with 11 other trig and hyperbolic functions, was added with AMS version 2.07. It can be easily replaced on earlier versions with 1/cos(x), which is what it simplifies to anyway.

For many common angles, {{sec()}} can compute an exact result. Other angles, the calculator will leave alone unless it's in approximate mode (or unless you make it approximate), and then it will give a decimal approximation. As long as the calculator is in radian [[[68k:mode-settings|mode]]], {{sec()}} can be used with complex numbers as well.

If {{sec()}} is applied to a list, it will take the secant of every element in the list. However, it can't be applied to matrices the way {{[[[68k:cos|cos()]]]}} can (this is probably an oversight; all the trig and hyperbolic functions that were present in all AMS versions work with matrices, but the ones added in version 2.07 do not).
