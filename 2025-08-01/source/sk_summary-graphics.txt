# Creating graphics is done on the __graph screen__, not the home screen.
# On the graph screen, locations are given either as __point__ or __pixel__ coordinates.
# Pixel coordinates start with (0,0) at the top left corner, like on the homescreen, but increment in individual pixels.
# Point coordinates depend on the __window__ dimensions.
# You can adjust the window dimensions by manipulating the __window variables__ and/or by using the __zoom__ commands.
# You can also use the __format__ commands to turn the axes off and other related things.
# You can save the window dimensions, format options, and other related things in a __GBD__. (Graph Database)
# Once you have the graph screen set up, you can draw on it using the __draw__ commands.
# You can erase the graph screen with the __ClrDraw__ command, and you can save what is on the graph screen in a __Pic__.(Picture)
# Unfortunately Pics can only store the __entire screen__.  They also don't force pixels that are already black to become white; sometimes this can be a good thing.
# One particularly creative and effective way to create sprites is known as the __text sprite__ method.This involves __overlapping__ text to create sprites quickly.
