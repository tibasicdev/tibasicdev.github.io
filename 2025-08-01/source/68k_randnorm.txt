The randNorm() command generates a random number that is normally distributed, with a given mean (first parameter) and standard deviation (second parameter). This means that on average, randNorm(x,y) will give a result of about x; it's 95% certain to be within 2*y of x.

See [[[68k:rand()]]] and [[[68k:RandSeed]]] for more details on the random number generator.

+ Formula

The formula for randNorm() is different from the one used by the TI-83 series. To generate normally-distributed values from the output of rand(), the calculator uses the polar form of the [wikipedia:Box-Muller_transform Box-Muller transform]. The algorithm goes as follows:

First, generate two uniformly distributed numbers //u// and //v// in [-1,1]. Keep doing this until the result lies in the unit circle; the point (0,0), though it's unlikely to occur, is discarded as well. Let //s// equal //u//^^2^^+//v//^^2^^. 

Usually, Box-Muller is used to produce two normally-distributed random numbers, by the formula below. The TI only uses the second of the results:
[[include inc:68k-math
|eqn=z_0=u\cdot\sqrt{\frac{-2\ln s}{s}}\hspace{2em}z_1=v\cdot\sqrt{\frac{-2\ln s}{s}}
]]

The result is distributed according to the standard normal distribution: that is, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It's easy to get any other normal distribution by scaling: multiplying by the standard deviation, and then adding the mean.

In TI-Basic, the code for randNorm(μ,σ) would be:
[[code]]
:Loop
: 2*rand()-1→u
: 2*rand()-1→v
: u^2+v^2→s
: If 0<s and s<1
:  Return μ+σ*v*√(-2*ln(s)/s)
:EndLoop
