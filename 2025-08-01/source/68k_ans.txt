Simply put, the {{ans()}} function returns an answer that the calculator has already returned. The argument specifies which answer to return, and must be an integer between 1 and 99 and may not be an expression or a variable. For example {{ans(1)}}, the default, will return the last answer displayed on the home screen. {{ans(3)}}, however, will return return the third most recent answer. If no argument is provided, the calculator assumes 1. Strangely, while official documentation states that the argument must be between 1 and 99, 0 may be used, which returns the same answer as if 1 were used (this is probably why {{ans()}} returns the most recent answer, even though no argument is provided).

+ Advanced Uses

When entered into a program, the calculator will automatically change the {{ans()}} command into whatever value it represents at runtime, so that even if the home screen changes, the program will always return the same value of the {{ans()}} function as the first time it was run. This may be avoided by using the {{expr()}} function and putting the {{ans()}} function in quotes to make it a string. For example: {{expr("ans(3)")}}. This can be rather cumbersome, however, and generally anything that you can do with the {{ans()}} function can be accomplished equally well with a variable.
